173 x 167
A=173
B=167

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 173
  B chunks: 167

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 173*167
          = 28891

Raw buckets:
  [28891]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=28891 -> carry=28, digit=891
    bucket0=891
    top=28

Final chunks (left to right):
  28 | 891

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  28891

Answer:
  173 * 167 = 
\box{28891}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

1. **Splitting into chunks:**
   - A = 173 (single chunk)
   - B = 167 (single chunk)
   
   Since both numbers are only 3 digits, splitting into 3-digit chunks is straightforward and correct.

2. **Convolution:**
   - Multiply each chunk: 173 * 167
   - Calculated as 173 * 167 = 28,891, which seems correct.
   - This is stored in bucket0, which is correct since i+j=0+0=0.

3. **Carrying:**
   - 28,891 is split into a digit and a carry:
     - carry = 28
     - digit = 891
   - These are correctly separated.
   - Result after carrying:
     - Bucket0: 891
     - Next bucket (bucket1): 28 (carry)

4. **Recombination:**
   - The final answer is reconstructed as 28 (most significant part) + 891 (least significant part).
   - This forms 28,891.
   - The answer in the box is 28891, matching this value.

5. **Verification:**
   - 173 * 167:
     - 170 * 167 = 28,390
     - 3 * 167 = 501
     - Sum: 28,390 + 501 = 28,891
   - The calculation matches the final answer.

**All steps - splitting, convolution, carrying, and recombination - are correctly performed, and the final product matches the actual multiplication.**

**Final verdict: \box{correct}**
