37525 x 45100
A=37525
B=45100

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 880, 13
  B chunks: 923, 34

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 880*923
          = 812240

  bucket1 = 880*34 + 13*923
          = 29920 + 11999
          = 41919

  bucket2 = 13*34
          = 442

Raw buckets:
  [812240, 41919, 442]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=812240 -> carry=812, digit=240
    bucket0=240
    bucket1=41919+812=42731

  bucket1=42731 -> carry=42, digit=731
    bucket1=731
    bucket2=442+42=484

  bucket2=484 -> carry=0, digit=484
    bucket2=484
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 692 | 377 | 500

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1692377500

Answer:
  37525 * 45100 = 
\box{1692377500}

Let's analyze each step in detail.

### PHASE 1: Chunk Splitting

37525 and 45100, chunk size 3, right to left.

For A = 37525:
- Rightmost 3 digits: 525
- Left: 37
- Should be: [525, 37] (not 880, 13 as in the transcript!)

For B = 45100:
- Rightmost 3 digits: 100
- Left: 45
- Should be: [100, 45] (not 923, 34 as in the transcript!)

**Transcript uses:**
A chunks: 880, 13
B chunks: 923, 34

This is already a major error in chunk splitting.

---

### PHASE 2: Convolution

Given incorrect chunks (880, 13 and 923, 34), all subsequent multiplication and bucket totals are invalid.

---

### PHASE 3: Carrying

Carrying steps are based on the previous incorrect buckets and so must also be wrong.

---

### PHASE 4: Recombination

Recombining the incorrect chunks produces the answer: 1692377500, which is not the product of 37525 and 45100.

Let's compute the correct answer:
37525 × 45100 = 1692557500

So, the answer differs as well.

---

## Summary of Errors

- **Step 1**: Chunk splitting is completely wrong.
- **Step 2-4**: All calculations based on incorrect chunks.
- **Final answer**: Does not match the correct product.
