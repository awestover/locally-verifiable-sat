14 x 8
A=14
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 14
  B chunks: 8

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 14*8
          = 112

Raw buckets:
  [112]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=112 -> carry=0, digit=112
    bucket0=112
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  112

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  112

Answer:
  14 * 8 = 
\box{112}
