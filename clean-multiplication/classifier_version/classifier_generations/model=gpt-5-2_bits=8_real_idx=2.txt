179 x 216
A=179
B=216

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 179
  B chunks: 216

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 179*216
          = 38664

Raw buckets:
  [38664]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=38664 -> carry=38, digit=664
    bucket0=664
    top=38

Final chunks (left to right):
  38 | 664

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  38664

Answer:
  179 * 216 = 
\box{38664}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

Chunks are split correctly: with 3-digit base-1000 chunking, \(179\) and \(216\) each form a single chunk.

Convolution is correct:
- Only bucket0 exists, and \(179 \times 216 = 38664\).

Carrying is correct (base \(1000\)):
- \(38664 = 38 \cdot 1000 + 664\), so chunks become \(38 \mid 664\).

Recombination is correct:
- \(38\) followed by padded \(664\) gives \(38664\).

Independent check: \(179 \times 216 = 179(200+16)=35800+2864=38664\), matching.

\(\boxed{correct}\)
