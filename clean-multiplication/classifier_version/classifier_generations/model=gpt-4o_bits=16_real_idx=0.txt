36020 x 62791
A=36020
B=62791

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 20, 36
  B chunks: 791, 62

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 20*791
          = 15820

  bucket1 = 20*62 + 36*791
          = 1240 + 28476
          = 29716

  bucket2 = 36*62
          = 2232

Raw buckets:
  [15820, 29716, 2232]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=15820 -> carry=15, digit=820
    bucket0=820
    bucket1=29716+15=29731

  bucket1=29731 -> carry=29, digit=731
    bucket1=731
    bucket2=2232+29=2261

  bucket2=2261 -> carry=2, digit=261
    bucket2=261
    top=2

Final chunks (left to right):
  2 | 261 | 731 | 820

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  2261731820

Answer:
  36020 * 62791 = 
\box{2261731820}

To verify the multiplication, let's go through the steps outlined in the transcript to ensure their correctness.

### Phase 1: Splitting into Chunks
- \( A = 36020 \) splits into chunks \( 20 \), \( 36 \).
- \( B = 62791 \) splits into chunks \( 791 \), \( 62 \).
- This step is correct, as the chunks are divided correctly right to left, considering the base of \( 1000 \).

### Phase 2: Convolution
- **Bucket 0**: \( 20 \times 791 = 15820 \). This calculation is correct.
- **Bucket 1**: \( 20 \times 62 + 36 \times 791 = 1240 + 28476 = 29716 \). This calculation is correct.
- **Bucket 2**: \( 36 \times 62 = 2232 \). This calculation is correct.
- The raw buckets are correctly computed as \([15820, 29716, 2232]\).

### Phase 3: Carrying
1. **Bucket 0**: \( 15820 \)
   - \( \text{carry} = 15 \), \( \text{digit} = 820 \)
   - New Bucket 0: \( 820 \)
   - Bucket 1: \( 29716 + 15 = 29731 \)
   
2. **Bucket 1**: \( 29731 \)
   - \( \text{carry} = 29 \), \( \text{digit} = 731 \)
   - New Bucket 1: \( 731 \)
   - Bucket 2: \( 2232 + 29 = 2261 \)

3. **Bucket 2**: \( 2261 \)
   - \( \text{carry} = 2 \), \( \text{digit} = 261 \)
   - New Bucket 2: \( 261 \)
   - Top value: \( 2 \)

The carrying rules are applied correctly throughout.

### Phase 4: Recombine
- The final number, reading left to right is \( 2 | 261 | 731 | 820 \).
- Reconstructing, we align the digits as \( 2261731820 \).

### Final Answer Verification
The steps leading to the final result and the way chunks are recombined are done correctly. The final answer is correctly derived as \( 2261731820 \).

Based on the analysis, every part of the process was executed correctly. 

\(\boxed{\text{correct}}\)
