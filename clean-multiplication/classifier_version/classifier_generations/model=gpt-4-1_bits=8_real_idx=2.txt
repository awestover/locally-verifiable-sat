TRANSCRIPT

191 x 149
A=191
B=149

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 191
  B chunks: 149

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 191*149
          = 28459

Raw buckets:
  [28459]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=28459 -> carry=28, digit=459
    bucket0=459
    top=28

Final chunks (left to right):
  28 | 459

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  28459

Answer:
  191 * 149 = 
\box{28459}

AI RESPONSE

Let me step through the transcript and verify each phase:

---

### PHASE 1: Splitting into Chunks

- A = 191, B = 149
- Chunk size = 3, so both are already single chunks.
- A chunks: [191], B chunks: [149]
- ✔️ This is correct.

---

### PHASE 2: Convolution / Bucket Calculation

- Buckets: (i, j) = (0,0) only (since only one chunk each)
- bucket0 = 191 × 149 = 28459
- ✔️ This calculation is correct.

---

### PHASE 3: Carrying

- bucket0=28459
  - 28459 ÷ 1000 = 28 remainder 459
  - So, digit = 459, carry = 28.
- According to the rules, digit stays in bucket0, carry moves to the next higher bucket (which here will be the "top" or new bucket on the left).
  - bucket0 = 459
  - bucket1/top = 28
- So, the chunks left to right should be: 28 | 459
- ✔️ This is correct.

---

### PHASE 4: Recombination

From chunks 28 | 459 (where 459 should be 3 digits), recombined number is:
- 28 * 1000 + 459 = 28000 + 459 = 28459

- The transcript recombined as 28459.
- ✔️ This is correct.

---

### FINAL: Does the answer match what 191 × 149 actually is?

- 191 × 149
  = (190 × 149) + (1 × 149)
  = (190 × 149) = 28310
  + 149
  = 28459

- So, 191 × 149 = 28459

---

## VERDICT

All steps, calculations, and rules are followed correctly, and the final answer is accurate.

\box{correct}
