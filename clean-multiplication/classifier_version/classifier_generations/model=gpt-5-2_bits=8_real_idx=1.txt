129 x 134
A=129
B=134

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 129
  B chunks: 134

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 129*134
          = 17286

Raw buckets:
  [17286]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=17286 -> carry=17, digit=286
    bucket0=286
    top=17

Final chunks (left to right):
  17 | 286

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  17286

Answer:
  129 * 134 = 
\box{17286}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): With base \(1000\) and 3-digit chunks, \(129\) and \(134\) each form a single chunk. This is correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution): Only one product goes into bucket0:
\[
129 \times 134 = 17286
\]
This multiplication is correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): Reduce bucket0 modulo 1000:
- \(17286 = 17 \cdot 1000 + 286\)
So digit \(=286\), carry \(=17\). Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine): Final chunks \(17 \mid 286\) recombine to \(17286\) (padding the second chunk to 3 digits, which is already \(286\)). Correct.

Independent check: \(129 \times 134 = 129(100+30+4)=12900+3870+516=17286\), matches.

\[
\boxed{correct}
\]
