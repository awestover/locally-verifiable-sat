217 x 129
A=217
B=129

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 217
  B chunks: 129

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 217*129
          = 27993

Raw buckets:
  [27993]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=27993 -> carry=27, digit=993
    bucket0=993
    top=27

Final chunks (left to right):
  27 | 993

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  27993

Answer:
  217 * 129 = 
\box{27993}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

Chunks are split correctly: with 3-digit chunks, \(217\) and \(129\) each form a single chunk.

Convolution is correct:
\[
217 \times 129 = 217(100+20+9)=21700+4340+1953=27993.
\]
So bucket0 \(=27993\) is correct.

Carrying is correct in base 1000:
\[
27993 = 27\cdot 1000 + 993,
\]
so digit \(=993\), carry/top \(=27\).

Recombination \(27|993 \to 27993\) is correct.

\[
\boxed{correct}
\]
