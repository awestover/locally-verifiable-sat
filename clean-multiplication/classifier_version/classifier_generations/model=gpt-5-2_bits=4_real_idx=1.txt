13 x 11
A=13
B=11

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 13
  B chunks: 11

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 13*11
          = 143

Raw buckets:
  [143]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=143 -> carry=0, digit=143
    bucket0=143
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  143

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  143

Answer:
  13 * 11 = 
\box{143}

============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): With BASE = 1000 and numbers 13 and 11, each is a single chunk: A = [13], B = [11]. Correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution/buckets): Only bucket0 exists (i=j=0):  
13 × 11 = 143, so raw buckets = [143]. Correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): 143 < 1000, so carry = 0 and bucket0 stays 143. Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine): Single chunk → result 143. Correct.

Also, ordinary multiplication confirms 13 × 11 = 143.
