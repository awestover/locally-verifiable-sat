10 x 9
A=10
B=9

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 10
  B chunks: 9

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 10*9
          = 90

Raw buckets:
  [90]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=90 -> carry=0, digit=90
    bucket0=90
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  90

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  90

Answer:
  10 * 9 = 
\box{90}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

Chunks are split correctly: \(10\) and \(9\) each fit in one 3-digit chunk.

Convolution is correct:
- bucket0 \(=10 \times 9 = 90\)

Carrying is correct (since \(90 < 1000\), no carry).

Recombination is correct, yielding \(90\).

Therefore the transcript matches the true product \(10 \times 9 = 90\).

\[\boxed{correct}\]
