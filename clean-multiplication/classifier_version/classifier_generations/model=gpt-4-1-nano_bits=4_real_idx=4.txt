10 x 14
A=10
B=14

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 10
  B chunks: 14

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 10*14
          = 140

Raw buckets:
  [140]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=140 -> carry=0, digit=140
    bucket0=140
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  140

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  140

Answer:
  10 * 14 = 
\box{140}

Let's analyze each step carefully:

1. Chunking:
   - A = 10
   - B = 14
   - Chunk size = 3 digits
   - The chunks are correctly identified as A: 10, B: 14. Although these are only 2-digit numbers, they are correctly taken as chunks since the total numbers are small.

2. Convolution:
   - Multiply each chunk of A by each chunk of B:
     - 10 * 14 = 140
   - Since each number has only one chunk, buckets are only one:
     - bucket0 = 140

3. Carrying:
   - bucket0 = 140
   - 140 < 1000, so no carry is generated.
   - Final bucket: 140

4. Recombination:
   - Since there's only one bucket, the final answer is 140.
   - The formatting shows the answer as 140, which is correctly aligned with the calculation.

5. Final answer:
   - The multiplication displayed is 10 * 14 = 140, which is correct.

**Additional notes:**
- The chunks are split correctly considering the small numbers.
- The convolution step is correctly calculated.
- Carrying and recombination are correctly performed.
- The final answer matches the product of 10 and 14.

**Verdict:**
All steps are correct, and the final answer is accurate.
