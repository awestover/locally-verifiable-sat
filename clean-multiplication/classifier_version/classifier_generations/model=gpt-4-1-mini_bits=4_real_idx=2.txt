13 x 13
A=13
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 13
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 13*13
          = 169

Raw buckets:
  [169]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=169 -> carry=0, digit=169
    bucket0=169
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  169

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  169

Answer:
  13 * 13 = 
\box{169}

Step 1: Splitting into chunks
- Both numbers A=13 and B=13 are chunked with a size of 3 digits.
- Since 13 is less than 1000, each number results in a single chunk: A chunks=[13], B chunks=[13].
- The chunking is correct.

Step 2: Convolution buckets
- With only one chunk each, only one product: 13*13=169.
- bucket0 = 169.
- This is correct.

Step 3: Carrying
- bucket0=169 which is less than 1000, so carry=0, digit=169.
- No carrying needed; bucket0 remains 169.
- This is correct.

Step 4: Recombine
- Only one chunk, 169, so the final answer is 169.
- 13*13 actually equals 169.
- The answer matches the calculation.

All steps and calculations are correct.
