234 x 246
A=234
B=246

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 234
  B chunks: 246

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 234*246
          = 57564

Raw buckets:
  [57564]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=57564 -> carry=57, digit=564
    bucket0=564
    top=57

Final chunks (left to right):
  57 | 564

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  57564

Answer:
  234 * 246 = 
\box{57564}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking):  
- With chunk size 3 and BASE = 1000, both numbers are each a single chunk: A = [234], B = [246]. This is correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution):  
- Only one product goes into bucket0: \(234 \times 246 = 57564\). Correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying):  
- Convert 57564 into base-1000 chunks:  
  - \(57564 = 57 \cdot 1000 + 564\) so carry = 57, digit = 564.  
  - bucket0 becomes 564 and the next (top) chunk is 57. Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine):  
- Chunks \(57 | 564\) recombine to \(57,564\) (no extra padding issues). Correct.

Cross-check: \(234 \times 246 = 234(200+40+6)=46800+9360+1404=57564\). Matches.
