TRANSCRIPT

11 x 14
A=11
B=14

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 23
  B chunks: 88

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 23*88
          = 2024

Raw buckets:
  [2024]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=2024 -> carry=2, digit=24
    bucket0=24
    top=2

Final chunks (left to right):
  154

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  154

Answer:
  11 * 14 = 
\box{154}

The transcript contains errors — \box{incorrect}

Summary of issues:
- Chunking is wrong. With BASE = 1000 and A = 11, B = 14, the correct chunks are A = [11], B = [14]. The transcript shows A chunks = 23 and B chunks = 88, which are incorrect.
- Because the chunks are wrong, the convolution step is wrong (they computed 23*88 = 2024 — that product is correct for those chunks but those chunks do not come from 11 and 14).
- The carry for 2024 (2024 = 2*1000 + 24) was computed correctly, but the recombination is inconsistent: carrying would produce chunks [2, 24] → "2" + "024" = 2024, yet the transcript gives final chunks/answer 154.
- The true correct computation with the stated BASE would be bucket0 = 11*14 = 154 and no carries, yielding final answer 154. Although the final numeric answer shown (154) happens to equal the true product, the internal steps are incorrect and inconsistent.

Therefore the transcript is incorrect.
