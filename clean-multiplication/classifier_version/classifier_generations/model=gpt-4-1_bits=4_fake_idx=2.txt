10 x 9
A=10
B=9

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 80
  B chunks: 5

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 80*5
          = 400

Raw buckets:
  [400]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=400 -> carry=0, digit=400
    bucket0=400
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  90

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  90

Answer:
  10 * 9 = 
\box{90}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

### Step 1: A=10, B=9
- Correctly extracted.

### Step 2: Split into chunks of 3 digits, BASE=1000
- Right to left chunking:
  - A (10): Should be [10] (since less than 1000, one chunk)
  - B (9): Should be [9] (since less than 1000, one chunk)

But transcript says:
  - A chunks: 80
  - B chunks: 5

**This is incorrect.** The numbers 10 and 9 are not chunked into 80 and 5. They should simply be 10 and 9.

### Step 3: Convolution (bucket calculation)
- Correct buckets (by the true chunks) would be:
  - bucket0 = 10 * 9 = 90

Transcript computes bucket0 = 80 * 5 = 400.

**This is also incorrect.** Wrong values multiplied, wrong product.

### Step 4: Carrying
- It keeps 400 in bucket0, which is already wrong, and no carry needed.

### Final recombine
- "Final chunks (left to right): 90"
- "Answer: 10 * 9 = 90"

This "final" answer is actually correct (10*9=90), but it doesn't match the chain of computations based on the previous steps (they had 400, then wrote 90).

**Conclusion:**
- Chunks are not correct.
- Bucket calculation is based on wrong numbers.
- Carrying is unnecessary, but the numbers used are wrong.
- Final answer is correct numerically, but not as a result of the previous calculations.

**Verdict:** The multiplication process shown contains errors.
