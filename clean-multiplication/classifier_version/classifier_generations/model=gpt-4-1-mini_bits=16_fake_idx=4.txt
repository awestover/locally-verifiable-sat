48789 x 51107
A=48789
B=51107

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 929, 87
  B chunks: 137, 37

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 929*137
          = 127273

  bucket1 = 929*37 + 87*137
          = 34373 + 11919
          = 46292

  bucket2 = 87*37
          = 3219

Raw buckets:
  [127273, 46292, 3219]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=127273 -> carry=127, digit=273
    bucket0=273
    bucket1=46292+127=46419

  bucket1=46419 -> carry=46, digit=419
    bucket1=419
    bucket2=3219+46=3265

  bucket2=3265 -> carry=3, digit=265
    bucket2=265
    top=3

Final chunks (left to right):
  2 | 493 | 459 | 423

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  2493459423

Answer:
  48789 * 51107 = 
\box{2493459423}

Step 1: Check chunk splitting
- A=48789 split into 3-digit chunks right to left should be 789 and 48.
- B=51107 split into 3-digit chunks should be 107 and 51.
In transcript:
- A chunks: 929, 87 (WRONG, 929 and 87 not from 48789)
- B chunks: 137, 37 (WRONG, 137 and 37 not from 51107)

Already the chunk splitting is incorrect.

Step 2: Buckets calculation (convolution)
Since chunks are wrong, products and sums are based on wrong values, so the bucket calculations are incorrect.

Step 3: Carrying
Carrying was done on bucket values calculated incorrectly, so carrying is based on wrong numbers.

Step 4: Final answer
Recombination of final chunks 2 | 493 | 459 | 423 gives 2493459423.
Check if 48789 * 51107 = 2493459423
Calculate actual product:
48789 * 51107 
= 48789 * (50000 + 1107)
= 48789*50000 + 48789*1107
= 2,439,450,000 + (48789*1107)
Calculate 48789*1107:
  48789 * 1000 = 48,789,000
  48789 * 100 = 4,878,900
  48789 * 7 = 341,523
Sum = 48,789,000 + 4,878,900 + 341,523 = 53,009,423
Add to 2,439,450,000:
  2,439,450,000 + 53,009,423 = 2,492,459,423

Wait the transcript's final answer was 2493459423 or 2,493,459,423 which differs from the correct product by about 1,000.

So their final answer is 2,493,459,423 and actual correct product is 2,492,459,423.

Difference is 1,000 which may indicate a calculation error.

Conclusion:
- Chunk splitting incorrect
- Bucket calculation incorrect
- Carrying done on wrong buckets
- Final answer incorrect by 1,000
