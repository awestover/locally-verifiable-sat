12 x 11
A=12
B=11

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 12
  B chunks: 11

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 12*11
          = 132

Raw buckets:
  [132]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=132 -> carry=0, digit=132
    bucket0=132
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  132

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  132

Answer:
  12 * 11 = 
\box{132}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

Everything checks out.

- Chunking: both numbers are <1000, so single chunks "12" and "11" are correct.
- Convolution: bucket0 = 12 * 11 = 132 is correct.
- Carrying: bucket0 < 1000 so carry = 0, digit = 132 — correct.
- Recombination: yields 132, which equals 12 × 11.

Final verdict: \box{correct}
