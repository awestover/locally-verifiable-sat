8 x 13
A=8
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 8
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 8*13
          = 104

Raw buckets:
  [104]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=104 -> carry=0, digit=104
    bucket0=104
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  104

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  104

Answer:
  8 * 13 = 
\box{104}

To determine if the multiplication in the transcript is correct, let's evaluate it step-by-step:

1. **Phase 1: Splitting into chunks**
   - A = 8 is split into a chunk: [8]
   - B = 13 is split into a chunk: [13]
   - These are single-digit numbers, so splitting them into chunks of up to 3 digits each is correct.

2. **Phase 2: Convolution (Bucket calculation)**
   - We multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B and place the product in the appropriate bucket.
   - Bucket0: 8 * 13 = 104.
   - The raw buckets calculation seems correct: [104].

3. **Phase 3: Carrying**
   - We're instructed to carry over any value greater than 1000, but since 104 is less than 1000, no carrying is needed.
   - Therefore, Bucket0 remains 104. The carrying step has been applied correctly.

4. **Phase 4: Recombining the chunks**
   - The final number formed is 104, as no padding is necessary beyond the given chunks.
   - The recombination step is executed correctly.

After reviewing each step and ensuring that all intermediate calculations were executed correctly, the final answer provided is indeed correct.
