11 x 14
A=11
B=14

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 11
  B chunks: 14

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 11*14
          = 154

Raw buckets:
  [154]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=154 -> carry=0, digit=154
    bucket0=154
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  154

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  154

Answer:
  11 * 14 = 
\box{154}

All steps are correct.

1. Chunking: 11 and 14 each fit in one 3-digit chunk — correct.
2. Convolution: bucket0 = 11 * 14 = 154 — correct.
3. Carrying: 154 < 1000 so no carry — correct.
4. Recombination: yields 154, and 11 × 14 = 154 — correct.
