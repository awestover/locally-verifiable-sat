63201 x 50283
A=63201
B=50283

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 611, 30
  B chunks: 293, 55

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 611*293
          = 179023

  bucket1 = 611*55 + 30*293
          = 33605 + 8790
          = 42395

  bucket2 = 30*55
          = 1650

Raw buckets:
  [179023, 42395, 1650]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=179023 -> carry=179, digit=23
    bucket0=23
    bucket1=42395+179=42574

  bucket1=42574 -> carry=42, digit=574
    bucket1=574
    bucket2=1650+42=1692

  bucket2=1692 -> carry=1, digit=692
    bucket2=692
    top=1

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 177 | 935 | 883

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3177935883

Answer:
  63201 * 50283 = 
\box{3177935883}

PHASE 1 (chunking): **Incorrect**.  
- With 3-digit chunks, \(63201\) should split as **[63, 201]**, not **[611, 30]**.  
- \(50283\) should split as **[50, 283]**, not **[293, 55]**.  
So the transcript is not even operating on the original numbers.

PHASE 2 (bucket products): Even for their (wrong) chunks, there are errors.  
- \(611 \times 293 = 178{,}? \) Actually \(611 \times 293 = 178{,}? = 611(300-7)=183{,}300-4{,}277=179{,}023\) (this one is correct).  
- \(611 \times 55 = 33{,}605\) correct.  
- \(30 \times 293 = 8{,}790\) correct.  
- Bucket sums: \(33{,}605 + 8{,}790 = 42{,}395\) correct.  
- \(30 \times 55 = 1{,}650\) correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): Carry steps from the raw buckets **are consistent**:
- \([179023, 42395, 1650]\) → after carries gives top \(=1\), buckets \([23, 574, 692]\). That corresponds to chunks **[1, 692, 574, 023]**, i.e. \(1|692|574|023 = 1{,}692{,}574{,}023\).
But the transcript instead states final chunks **“3 | 177 | 935 | 883”**, which does **not** match the carried buckets they computed.

PHASE 4 (final recombination): Their final number \(3{,}177{,}935{,}883\) doesn’t match the bucket result, and also doesn’t match the true product.

True check:  
\(63{,}201 \times 50{,}283 = 3{,}178{,}518{,}483\), not \(3{,}177{,}935{,}883\).
