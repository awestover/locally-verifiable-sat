10 x 13
A=10
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 10
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 10*13
          = 130

Raw buckets:
  [130]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=130 -> carry=0, digit=130
    bucket0=130
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  130

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  130

Answer:
  10 * 13 = 
\box{130}

Step 1: Splitting the numbers into chunks:
- A=10, since it has only two digits, it becomes one chunk: [10].
- B=13, also one chunk: [13].
This step is correct.

Step 2: Convolution (multiplying chunks):
- bucket0 = 10 * 13 = 130.
Since each has only one chunk, only bucket0 exists.
This step is correct.

Step 3: Carrying steps:
- bucket0=130 which is less than the base (1000), so carry=0 and digit=130.
No changes needed.
This step is correct.

Step 4: Recombing chunks:
- Final result is 130, which matches 10*13.
This step is correct.

Since all steps are done correctly and the final answer matches, the multiplication is:

\box{correct}
