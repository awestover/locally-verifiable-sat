9 x 10
A=9
B=10

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 9
  B chunks: 10

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 9*10
          = 90

Raw buckets:
  [90]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=90 -> carry=0, digit=90
    bucket0=90
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  90

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  90

Answer:
  9 * 10 = 
\box{90}

Let's go through the transcript step by step:

**Numbers:**
- A = 9
- B = 10

**PHASE 1: Splitting into 3-digit chunks**
- A chunks: [9]
- B chunks: [10]

Since both numbers fit within 3 digits, their chunks are correctly split.

**PHASE 2: Convolution**
- We multiply every chunk of A by every chunk of B and store the result in a bucket based on the sum of their indices.
- A has one chunk: 9
- B has one chunk: 10

Calculating the product:
- 9 * 10 = 90

This result correctly goes into bucket0:
- bucket0 = 90

**PHASE 3: Carrying**
- We ensure each bucket is less than 1000.
- For bucket0, we have 90, which is already less than 1000, hence no carrying is needed.

Bucket values remain:
- bucket0 = 90

**PHASE 4: Recombination**
- The final answer is formed by recombining the values.
- Since we have only one chunk, it is simply represented as 90 without additional padding.

The final derived product from the steps is 90, which matches the expected product of 9 * 10.

Therefore, each step of the multiplication process was conducted correctly.
