134 x 189
A=134
B=189

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 134
  B chunks: 189

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 134*189
          = 25326

Raw buckets:
  [25326]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=25326 -> carry=25, digit=326
    bucket0=326
    top=25

Final chunks (left to right):
  25 | 326

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  25326

Answer:
  134 * 189 = 
\box{25326}

Let’s analyze the multiplication step by step according to the transcript:

---

**Step 1: Chunk Splitting**
- Input numbers: 134 and 189
- Chunk size = 3, so right-to-left we get:
  - A: [134]
  - B: [189]
- **This is correct.**

---

**Step 2: Convolution/Raw Buckets**
- Multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B, results into bucket0:
  - 134 × 189 = 25326
- Raw buckets: [25326]
- **Calculation:**
  - 134 × 189
    - 134 × 100 = 13400
    - 134 × 80 = 10720
    - 134 × 9 = 1206
    - Sum: 13400 + 10720 = 24120; 24120 + 1206 = 25326
- **Calculation is correct.**

---

**Step 3: Carrying**
- BASE = 1000, bucket0 = 25326
  - 25326 ÷ 1000 = 25 remainder 326, so carry = 25, digit = 326
- Now, bucket0 = 326, carry (top) = 25. There is no bucket1, so the top chunk is 25.
- **Carrying is correct.**

---

**Step 4: Recombine**
- Chunks: 25|326 (left to right)
- Pads all but the first chunk to 3 digits (as needed)
- Recombining: 25,326
- **This is correct.**

---

**Step 5: Final Verification**
- Is 134 × 189 = 25,326?
  - Yes: 134 × 189 = 25,326

---

**CONCLUSION:** Every step—chunking, convolution, carrying, recombination, and answer—has been performed correctly.
