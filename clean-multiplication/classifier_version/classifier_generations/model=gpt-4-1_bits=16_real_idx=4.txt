37671 x 48928
A=37671
B=48928

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 671, 37
  B chunks: 928, 48

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 671*928
          = 622688

  bucket1 = 671*48 + 37*928
          = 32208 + 34336
          = 66544

  bucket2 = 37*48
          = 1776

Raw buckets:
  [622688, 66544, 1776]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=622688 -> carry=622, digit=688
    bucket0=688
    bucket1=66544+622=67166

  bucket1=67166 -> carry=67, digit=166
    bucket1=166
    bucket2=1776+67=1843

  bucket2=1843 -> carry=1, digit=843
    bucket2=843
    top=1

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 843 | 166 | 688

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1843166688

Answer:
  37671 * 48928 = 
\box{1843166688}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

### Check 1: Chunk Splitting

A = 37671, B = 48928, chunk size = 3 digits.

- A chunks: 
  - Rightmost 3: 671
  - Remaining: 37
  
- B chunks:
  - Rightmost 3: 928
  - Remaining: 48

So, split is:
- A: [671, 37]
- B: [928, 48]

**Analysis:** Correct.

### Check 2: Bucket Calculations (Convolution)

Buckets are computed as (i,j) → put product in bucket (i+j):

- bucket0: 671*928
- bucket1: 671*48 + 37*928
- bucket2: 37*48

Let's compute these step by step:

#### bucket0:
671 × 928 = ?

Compute:
- 671 × 900 = 603,900
- 671 × 28 = 18,788
- Total = 603,900 + 18,788 = 622,688

**Matches transcript:** 622,688 ✔

#### bucket1:
= 671 × 48 + 37 × 928

First, 671 × 48:
- 600 × 48 = 28,800
- 71 × 48 = 3,408
- Total = 28,800 + 3,408 = 32,208

Second, 37 × 928:
- 30 × 928 = 27,840
- 7 × 928 = 6,496
- Total = 27,840 + 6,496 = 34,336

Sum: 32,208 + 34,336 = 66,544

**Matches transcript:** 66,544 ✔

#### bucket2:
37 × 48 = 1,776

**Correct.**

So, raw buckets: [622,688, 66,544, 1,776] ✔

---

### Check 3: Carrying

BASE = 1,000.

#### bucket0 = 622,688:

carry = 622, digit = 688  
bucket0 = 688  
Add carry to bucket1: 66,544 + 622 = 67,166

#### bucket1 = 67,166:

carry = 67, digit = 166  
bucket1 = 166  
Add carry to bucket2: 1,776 + 67 = 1,843

#### bucket2 = 1,843:

carry = 1, digit = 843  
bucket2 = 843  
Top (leftmost): 1

Final chunks (left to right): 1 | 843 | 166 | 688 ✔

---

### Check 4: Recombine

Chunks: 1 (1 digit), 843 (3 digits), 166 (3 digits), 688 (3 digits)

So: 1 843 166 688 → 1,843,166,688

---

### FINAL STEP: Actual Product

Now let's compute the real product of 37671 × 48928:

- 37671 × 48928 = ?

Quick calculation:
- 37671 × 48928 = 1,843,166,688

**Matches the transcript final answer. ✔**

## Verdict

All steps and calculations are correct.
