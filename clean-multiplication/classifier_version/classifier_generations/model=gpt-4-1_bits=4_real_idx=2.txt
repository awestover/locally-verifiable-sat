10 x 9
A=10
B=9

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 10
  B chunks: 9

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 10*9
          = 90

Raw buckets:
  [90]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=90 -> carry=0, digit=90
    bucket0=90
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  90

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  90

Answer:
  10 * 9 = 
\box{90}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

### PHASE 1: Splitting
- 10 split into 3-digit chunks: [10]
- 9 split into 3-digit chunks: [9]
This is correct since both numbers are less than 1000.

### PHASE 2: Convolution
- Only one chunk each, so:
  - bucket0 = 10*9 = 90
Buckets: [90]
This is correct.

### PHASE 3: Carrying
- bucket0 = 90, which is < 1000, so no carry needed.
- The transcript states:
  - bucket0=90 -> carry=0, digit=90
Final chunks: [90]
This is correct.

### PHASE 4: Recombine
- Only one chunk: 90
No padding needed.
Final answer presented: 90

### Final Check
- 10×9 = 90

Conclusion: All steps are carried out correctly. The answer is accurate.

Final verdict:  
\box{correct}
