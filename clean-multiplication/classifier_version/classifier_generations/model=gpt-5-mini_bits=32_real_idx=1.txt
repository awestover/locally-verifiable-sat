3996576523 x 2251239901
A=3996576523
B=2251239901

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 523, 576, 996, 3
  B chunks: 901, 239, 251, 2

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 523*901
          = 471223

  bucket1 = 523*239 + 576*901
          = 124997 + 518976
          = 643973

  bucket2 = 523*251 + 576*239 + 996*901
          = 131273 + 137664 + 897396
          = 268937 + 897396
          = 1166333

  bucket3 = 523*2 + 576*251 + 996*239 + 3*901
          = 1046 + 144576 + 238044 + 2703
          = 145622 + 238044 + 2703
          = 383666 + 2703
          = 386369

  bucket4 = 576*2 + 996*251 + 3*239
          = 1152 + 249996 + 717
          = 251148 + 717
          = 251865

  bucket5 = 996*2 + 3*251
          = 1992 + 753
          = 2745

  bucket6 = 3*2
          = 6

Raw buckets:
  [471223, 643973, 1166333, 386369, 251865, 2745, 6]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=471223 -> carry=471, digit=223
    bucket0=223
    bucket1=643973+471=644444

  bucket1=644444 -> carry=644, digit=444
    bucket1=444
    bucket2=1166333+644=1166977

  bucket2=1166977 -> carry=1166, digit=977
    bucket2=977
    bucket3=386369+1166=387535

  bucket3=387535 -> carry=387, digit=535
    bucket3=535
    bucket4=251865+387=252252

  bucket4=252252 -> carry=252, digit=252
    bucket4=252
    bucket5=2745+252=2997

  bucket5=2997 -> carry=2, digit=997
    bucket5=997
    bucket6=6+2=8

  bucket6=8 -> carry=0, digit=8
    bucket6=8
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  8 | 997 | 252 | 535 | 977 | 444 | 223

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  8997252535977444223

Answer:
  3996576523 * 2251239901 = 
\box{8997252535977444223}

\box{correct}

Reasoning (summary):
- Phase 1 (chunking): correct — A -> [523,576,996,3], B -> [901,239,251,2].
- Phase 2 (convolution): each bucket product was computed correctly (I checked each term and the bucket sums match).
- Phase 3 (carrying): the carries were computed and propagated correctly (each bucket reduced to <1000 and carries added to the next bucket as shown).
- Phase 4 (recombination): the final chunks 8 | 997 | 252 | 535 | 977 | 444 | 223 recombine to 8,997,252,535,977,444,223, which is the correct product.

Quick verification: A mod 1,000,000 = 576,523 and B mod 1,000,000 = 239,901, their product mod 1,000,000 is 444,223 — matching the transcript's last six digits. All intermediate checks (chunking, convolution terms, and carry steps) are consistent, so the transcript is correct.
