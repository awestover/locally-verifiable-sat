49560 x 39462
A=49560
B=39462

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 10, 84
  B chunks: 545, 44

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 10*545
          = 5450

  bucket1 = 10*44 + 84*545
          = 440 + 45780
          = 46220

  bucket2 = 84*44
          = 3696

Raw buckets:
  [5450, 46220, 3696]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=5450 -> carry=5, digit=450
    bucket0=450
    bucket1=46220+5=46225

  bucket1=46225 -> carry=46, digit=225
    bucket1=225
    bucket2=3696+46=3742

  bucket2=3742 -> carry=3, digit=742
    bucket2=742
    top=3

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 955 | 736 | 720

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1955736720

Answer:
  49560 * 39462 = 
\box{1955736720}

Let's analyze the process step by step:

### PHASE 1: Split into 3-digit chunks

**Given:**
- A = 49560, B = 39462

**Chunks expected:**
- A chunks: 560, 49
- B chunks: 462, 39

**Chunks in transcript:**
- A chunks given: 10, 84
- B chunks given: 545, 44

- Here, the given chunks do not match what we would expect from 3-digit chunks right to left. Therefore, there is an error in how the numbers are split into chunks.

### PHASE 2: Convolution (multiplication of chunks)

The step encompasses the calculations for each bucket based on the erroneous chunks:

- Calculations provided:
  - bucket0: 10*545 = 5450
  - bucket1: 10*44 + 84*545 = 440 + 45780 = 46220
  - bucket2: 84*44 = 3696
  
  These calculations are based on incorrect chunks A and B.

### PHASE 3: Carrying

- Carrying is performed on the buckets:
  - bucket0=5450 -> carry=5, digit=450
  - bucket1=46225 -> carry=46, digit=225
  - bucket2=3742 -> carry=3, digit=742
  - top=3

### PHASE 4: Recombine

- Final combination step based on transformed erroneous buckets yields the number 1955736720.

### Final Answer Verification

- The expected final multiplication, starting from accurate chunking, was not performed due to initial errors.

Since there was an error in the chunking process right at the start and all subsequent calculations depend on these chunks, the entire transcript is based on incorrect initial values.

Therefore, the provided multiplication transcript is incorrect.

Final verdict:

\box{incorrect}
