TRANSCRIPT
============================================================

15 x 8
A=15
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 76
  B chunks: 5

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 76*5
          = 380

Raw buckets:
  [380]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=380 -> carry=0, digit=380
    bucket0=380
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  120

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  120

Answer:
  15 * 8 = 
\box{120}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

The transcript is incorrect.

Summary of problems:
- Chunking is wrong: A = 15 should be chunked as [15] (or 015 if 3-digit), not 76. B = 8 should be chunked as [8], not 5.
- Convolution is inconsistent with the original numbers: they computed bucket0 = 76*5 = 380 (which is arithmeticly correct for 76*5) but that has nothing to do with 15*8.
- Carrying/recombination is wrong/inconsistent: raw buckets = [380] would give final value 380, not 120. They nevertheless output 120 with no valid step producing it from the buckets.
- The correct procedure would give bucket0 = 15*8 = 120, no carry, final answer 120. The transcript's final numeric answer (120) matches the true product by coincidence, but the steps shown are erroneous and inconsistent.

Final verdict:
\box{incorrect}
