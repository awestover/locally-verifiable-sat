10 x 13
A=10
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 28
  B chunks: 35

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 28*35
          = 980

Raw buckets:
  [980]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=980 -> carry=0, digit=980
    bucket0=980
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  130

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  130

Answer:
  10 * 13 = 
\box{130}

Let's analyze the transcript step-by-step:

The problem is 10 x 13.

Step 1) Splitting into 3-digit chunks (right to left):
- A=10 → the transcript says A chunks: 28
- B=13 → the transcript says B chunks: 35

This does not match the original numbers. "10" does NOT split into "28", and "13" does NOT split into "35".
Therefore, the original chunks are wrong.

Step 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B.
- They compute bucket0 = 28 * 35 = 980 correct for their wrong chunks.
- Raw buckets: [980].

Step 3) Carrying buckets to be < 1000 is correct with bucket0=980, no carry.

Step 4) Final answer given: 130
This is also wrong since the number 130 does not correspond to any actual correct multiplication of 10 and 13.

The multiplication of 10 and 13 is 130, so the final answer is correct, but due to wrongly splitting chunks (28 and 35 instead of 10 and 13), the process is invalid.

Therefore, the process is flawed because it does not correctly chunk the original numbers.

Final verdict: \box{incorrect}
