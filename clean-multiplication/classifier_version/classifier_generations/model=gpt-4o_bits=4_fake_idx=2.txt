13 x 8
A=13
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 72
  B chunks: 7

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 72*7
          = 504

Raw buckets:
  [504]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=504 -> carry=0, digit=504
    bucket0=504
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  104

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  104

Answer:
  13 * 8 = 
\box{104}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

1. Splitting into chunks:
   - A = 13 has been misrepresented as chunk '72'. It should be '13' itself since it has less than 3 digits.
   - B = 8 has been misrepresented as chunk '7'. It should be '8' itself.

2. Convolution:
   - The chunks are incorrectly represented, which subsequently leads to an incorrect multiplication:
     - Correct calculation: 13 * 8 = 104.
     - Transcript error: 72 * 7 = 504.

3. Carrying:
   - This step is incorrect as it processes based on the wrong convolution result (504 instead of 104).

4. Final Answer:
   - The final answer in the transcript is incorrect. The correct calculation should present "13 * 8 = 104". Instead, it shows \box{104} which is mistakenly considering the wrong intermediate computations.

The steps are based on incorrect initial chunking, leading to incorrect convolution and an incorrect final result. Therefore, the multiplication is not performed correctly.
