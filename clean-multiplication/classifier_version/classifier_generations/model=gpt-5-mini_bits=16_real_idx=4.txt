55110 x 49966
A=55110
B=49966

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 110, 55
  B chunks: 966, 49

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 110*966
          = 106260

  bucket1 = 110*49 + 55*966
          = 5390 + 53130
          = 58520

  bucket2 = 55*49
          = 2695

Raw buckets:
  [106260, 58520, 2695]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=106260 -> carry=106, digit=260
    bucket0=260
    bucket1=58520+106=58626

  bucket1=58626 -> carry=58, digit=626
    bucket1=626
    bucket2=2695+58=2753

  bucket2=2753 -> carry=2, digit=753
    bucket2=753
    top=2

Final chunks (left to right):
  2 | 753 | 626 | 260

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  2753626260

Answer:
  55110 * 49966 = 
\box{2753626260}

Checks:

- Chunking: A=55110 → (110, 55); B=49966 → (966, 49). Correct.
- Convolution:
  - bucket0 = 110 * 966 = 106,260. Correct.
  - bucket1 = 110 * 49 + 55 * 966 = 5,390 + 53,130 = 58,520. Correct.
  - bucket2 = 55 * 49 = 2,695. Correct.
- Carrying (base 1000):
  - bucket0: 106,260 → carry 106, digit 260 → bucket1 = 58,520 + 106 = 58,626. Correct.
  - bucket1: 58,626 → carry 58, digit 626 → bucket2 = 2,695 + 58 = 2,753. Correct.
  - bucket2: 2,753 → carry 2, digit 753 → top = 2. Correct.
- Recombine chunks: 2 | 753 | 626 | 260 → 2,753,626,260. Matches direct product 55110 * 49966.

Final verdict:
\box{correct}
