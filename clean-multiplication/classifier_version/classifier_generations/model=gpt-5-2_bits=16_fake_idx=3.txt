60204 x 51698
A=60204
B=51698

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 167, 93
  B chunks: 786, 53

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 167*786
          = 131262

  bucket1 = 167*53 + 93*786
          = 8851 + 73098
          = 81949

  bucket2 = 93*53
          = 4929

Raw buckets:
  [131262, 81949, 4929]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=131262 -> carry=131, digit=262
    bucket0=262
    bucket1=81949+131=82080

  bucket1=82080 -> carry=82, digit=80
    bucket1=80
    bucket2=4929+82=5011

  bucket2=5011 -> carry=5, digit=11
    bucket2=11
    top=5

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 112 | 426 | 392

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3112426392

Answer:
  60204 * 51698 = 
\box{3112426392}

PHASE 1 (chunking) is wrong.

- With chunk size 3 (BASE = 1000), you must split **60204** as **[60, 204]** (left to right) or **204 (i=0), 60 (i=1)** from the right.
- You must split **51698** as **[51, 698]** or **698 (i=0), 51 (i=1)**.

The transcript instead uses:
- A chunks: **167, 93**
- B chunks: **786, 53**

These do not correspond to the original numbers in base 1000, so everything after that is based on incorrect inputs.

PHASE 3 and PHASE 4 also contain internal inconsistencies:

- After carrying, the transcript obtains digits/top: top = 5, bucket2 = 11, bucket1 = 80, bucket0 = 262, which would recombine (with 3-digit padding) to **5 | 011 | 080 | 262 = 5011080262**, not **3112426392**.
- The stated “Final chunks (left to right): 3 | 112 | 426 | 392” does not match the carried bucket results they computed.

Finally, the true product is:
- \(60204 \times 51698 = 3,112,423,992\)

Their boxed answer **3112426392** differs from the correct value (it should be **3112423992**), off by 2400.
