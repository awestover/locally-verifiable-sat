10 x 9
A=10
B=9

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 25
  B chunks: 2

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 25*2
          = 50

Raw buckets:
  [50]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=50 -> carry=0, digit=50
    bucket0=50
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  90

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  90

Answer:
  10 * 9 = 
\box{90}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking) is wrong:  
- With chunk size 3, \(A=10\) should chunk to \([10]\), not \(25\).  
- \(B=9\) should chunk to \([9]\), not \(2\).

PHASE 2 (convolution) is therefore based on incorrect chunks (\(25\times 2\) instead of \(10\times 9\)).

PHASE 3 (carrying) is internally consistent with the (wrong) bucket value 50, but that bucket value is already incorrect.

PHASE 4 / Final chunks are inconsistent with the buckets:  
- Raw buckets are \([50]\), which would recombine to 50, not 90.  
- The transcript claims “Final chunks: 90” without support from the buckets.

Even though \(10\times 9 = 90\) is the correct true product, the shown work does not correctly produce it.
