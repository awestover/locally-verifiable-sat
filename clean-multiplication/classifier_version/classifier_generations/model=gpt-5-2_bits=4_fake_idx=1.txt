13 x 11
A=13
B=11

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 81
  B chunks: 73

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 81*73
          = 5913

Raw buckets:
  [5913]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=5913 -> carry=5, digit=913
    bucket0=913
    top=5

Final chunks (left to right):
  143

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  143

Answer:
  13 * 11 = 
\box{143}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): Incorrect. With chunk size 3 and base 1000, the numbers should remain as single chunks:
- A = 13 ⇒ A chunks should be [13], not 81
- B = 11 ⇒ B chunks should be [11], not 73

PHASE 2 (convolution): Uses the wrong chunks, so the bucket product 81×73=5913 is not based on the original numbers. The correct bucket0 would be 13×11 = 143.

PHASE 3 (carrying): The carry operation on 5913 is internally consistent (digit 913, carry 5), but it’s irrelevant because the starting bucket is wrong.

PHASE 4 (recombine/final): “Final chunks (left to right): 143” does not match the carried result from Phase 3 (which would correspond to chunks [5, 913] ⇒ 5913). So even within their own incorrect buckets, the recombination is inconsistent.

Verdict: \box{incorrect}
