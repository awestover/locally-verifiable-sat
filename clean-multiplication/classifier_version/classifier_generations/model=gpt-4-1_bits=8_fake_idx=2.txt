TRANSCRIPT

191 x 149
A=191
B=149

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 413
  B chunks: 473

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 413*473
          = 195349

Raw buckets:
  [195349]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=195349 -> carry=195, digit=349
    bucket0=349
    top=195

Final chunks (left to right):
  28 | 459

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  28459

Answer:
  191 * 149 = 
\box{28459}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step, following the provided instructions.

---

### PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)

Given numbers:
- A = 191
- B = 149

Chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000.

Splitting 191 and 149 into chunks (from right to left):
- For 191: only one chunk, 191
- For 149: only one chunk, 149

But in transcript it lists:
- A chunks: 413
- B chunks: 473

These are not the original numbers; the original numbers should be split as:
- A chunks: 191
- B chunks: 149

So step 1 has incorrect chunk splitting.

---

### PHASE 2) Convolution (multiply chunks into buckets)

Transcript shows:
bucket0 = 413 * 473 = 195349

But the correct calculation (if using correct chunks) would be:
bucket0 = 191 * 149 = 28459

The transcript does not reflect the correct numbers.

---

### PHASE 3) Carrying

Transcript says:

bucket0 = 195349 -> carry = 195, digit = 349  
Final chunks: 28 | 459

This comes from the wrong bucket value from phase 2, so the carrying process is moot.

---

### PHASE 4) Recombine

Transcript writes: 28459

This is the correct product of 191 × 149, but it's reached through incorrect work, and the carrying digits don't reflect the calculation actually performed.

---

### Final verdict

There are **multiple errors**:
- The chunks do NOT match the original numbers.
- The bucket multiplication uses wrong chunks and numbers.
- The carrying is applied to a wrong value.
- The final answer is correct, but not due to the steps shown.
