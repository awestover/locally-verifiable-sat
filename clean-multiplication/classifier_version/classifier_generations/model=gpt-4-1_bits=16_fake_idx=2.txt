40357 x 42406
A=40357
B=42406

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 822, 82
  B chunks: 556, 84

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 822*556
          = 457032

  bucket1 = 822*84 + 82*556
          = 69048 + 45592
          = 114640

  bucket2 = 82*84
          = 6888

Raw buckets:
  [457032, 114640, 6888]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=457032 -> carry=457, digit=32
    bucket0=32
    bucket1=114640+457=115097

  bucket1=115097 -> carry=115, digit=97
    bucket1=97
    bucket2=6888+115=7003

  bucket2=7003 -> carry=7, digit=3
    bucket2=3
    top=7

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 711 | 378 | 942

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1711378942

Answer:
  40357 * 42406 = 
\box{1711378942}

Let's break down and verify each phase step by step:

### PHASE 1: Splitting into Chunks

Given:
- A = 40357
- B = 42406
- Chunk size = 3 digits (from right)

**A chunks:**
- 40357 split into 3 digits from the right: `357`, `40`  (but transcript says 822, 82)
- Wait — the transcript says: "822, 82" for A, and "556, 84" for B; but let's check:

Let's do the split for both numbers:
- 40357: rightmost 3 digits = 357; left chunk = 40
  - So: A chunks should be [357, 40]

- 42406: rightmost 3 digits = 406; left chunk = 42
  - So: B chunks should be [406, 42]

**Error found:** The transcript lists A chunks as 822, 82 and B chunks as 556, 84, which **do not match** the given numbers. The correct split is [357, 40] and [406, 42].

### PHASE 2: Convolution

The buckets should be constructed using the actual chunks. The transcript does:

- bucket0 = 822*556 = 457032
- bucket1 = 822*84 + 82*556 = 69048 + 45592 = 114640
- bucket2 = 82*84 = 6888

But using the correct chunks ([357, 40], [406, 42]):
- Bucket 0 (i=0,j=0): 357*406 = 145,042 
- Bucket 1 (i=0,j=1 & i=1,j=0): 357*42 + 40*406 = 14,994 + 16,240 = 31,234
- Bucket 2 (i=1,j=1): 40*42 = 1,680

So the chunks used in the transcript are not from 40357 and 42406, but from other numbers. The multiplications are also based on those wrong numbers.

### PHASE 3: Carrying

Since the buckets were based on incorrect values, subsequent carrying is also incorrect.

### PHASE 4: Recombination

The recombined answer, 1711378942, is not the product of 40357 × 42406.

Let's check the real product:
40357 × 42406 = 1,710,791,942

But transcript gives 1,711,378,942 (with the mis-padded 1711378942 as the answer.)

### FINAL VERDICT: ERRORS

- **Chunks are not split from the given numbers.**
- **Bucket calculations do not use A=40357 or B=42406.**
- **Carrying is then invalid**
- **Final answer does not match product of 40357 × 42406**
