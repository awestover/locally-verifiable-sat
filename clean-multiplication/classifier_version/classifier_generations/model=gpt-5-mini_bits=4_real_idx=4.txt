8 x 8
A=8
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 8
  B chunks: 8

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 8*8
          = 64

Raw buckets:
  [64]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=64 -> carry=0, digit=64
    bucket0=64
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  64

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  64

Answer:
  8 * 8 = 
\box{64}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

All steps are correct.

- Chunking: 8 → [8] with 3-digit chunks is correct.
- Convolution: bucket0 = 8*8 = 64 is correct.
- Carrying: 64 < 1000 so no carry, buckets remain [64].
- Recombine: yields 64, which equals 8×8.

Final verdict:
\box{correct}
