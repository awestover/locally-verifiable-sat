194 x 196
A=194
B=196

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 194
  B chunks: 196

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 194*196
          = 38024

Raw buckets:
  [38024]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=38024 -> carry=38, digit=24
    bucket0=24
    top=38

Final chunks (left to right):
  38 | 24

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  38024

Answer:
  194 * 196 = 
\box{38024}

Analysis:

- Phase 1 (chunking): With chunk size 3 (BASE = 1000), splitting 194 and 196 right-to-left yields single chunks 194 and 196 — correct.

- Phase 2 (convolution): Only bucket0 exists: 194 * 196 = 38024 — correct.

- Phase 3 (carrying): For BASE=1000, carry = floor(38024/1000) = 38 and digit = 38024 - 38*1000 = 24. They set bucket0=24 and carried 38 to the next (top) bucket — correct.

- Phase 4 (recombine): Final chunks left-to-right are [38, 24]. Recombining with 3-digit padding on lower chunks gives 38 || 024 = 38024 — matches the computed product.

The arithmetic is consistent at every step and the final result 38024 is correct.
