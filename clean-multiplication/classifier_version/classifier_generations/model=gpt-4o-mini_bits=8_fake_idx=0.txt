TRANSCRIPT

202 x 210
A=202
B=210

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 555
  B chunks: 372

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 555*372
          = 206460

Raw buckets:
  [206460]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=206460 -> carry=206, digit=460
    bucket0=460
    top=206

Final chunks (left to right):
  42 | 420

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  42420

Answer:
  202 * 210 = 
\box{42420}

To determine whether the multiplication is performed correctly in the transcript, let’s analyze each step carefully.

1. **Check Chunk Splitting:**
   - The original numbers are 202 and 210.
   - The transcript claims to split 202 into 555 and 210 into 372. 
   - This is incorrect as 202 should remain as a single chunk: 202, and 210 should also remain as a single chunk: 210. Therefore, the chunks are not split correctly.

2. **Bucket Calculations:**
   - The multiplication performed in the bucket is 555 * 372 = 206460. 
   - Since the chunks were identified incorrectly, we do not need to validate this calculation because the premise itself is invalid due to incorrect chunking.

3. **Check Carrying Steps:**
   - In the carrying process, bucket0 = 206460 is broken down to carry = 206 and digit = 460. 
   - This assumes the previous multiplication was correct, but since the initial chunks are incorrect, this calculation and process are also invalid.

4. **Final Answer Verification:**
   - The purported final answer based on the bucket arrangement is 42420.
   - However, the multiplication 202 * 210 should yield 42420, which is indeed correct, but this is incidental since the method to arrive at that conclusion is flawed due to incorrect initial chunking and subsequent calculations.

**Final Verdict:**
Since the calculation was based on an invalid chunking method, the process contains errors. Thus, the overall multiplication is declared:

\box{incorrect}
