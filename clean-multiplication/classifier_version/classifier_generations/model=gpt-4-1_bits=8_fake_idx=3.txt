TRANSCRIPT

134 x 189
A=134
B=189

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 833
  B chunks: 712

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 833*712
          = 593096

Raw buckets:
  [593096]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=593096 -> carry=593, digit=96
    bucket0=96
    top=593

Final chunks (left to right):
  25 | 326

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  25326

Answer:
  134 * 189 = 
\box{25326}

Let’s analyze the transcript step by step according to the instructions:

## Step 1: Split Into 3-digit Chunks

Given numbers:
- A = 134
- B = 189

Since both numbers are under 1000, each is a single “chunk”:
- A chunks: [134]
- B chunks: [189]

**Transcript says:**
- A chunks: 833
- B chunks: 712

**ERROR DETECTED:** These do not match the original numbers. “833” and “712” are not the 3-digit decomposition of 134 and 189.

## Step 2: Convolution (Multiplication of Chunks)

Should be:
- bucket0 = 134 * 189 = 25326

**Transcript says:**
- bucket0 = 833 * 712 = 593096

**ERROR DETECTED:** This step multiplies the wrong values.

## Step 3: Carrying

Should be done if there are multiple buckets > BASE. Here:
- Only one bucket: 25326
  - 25326 divided by 1000 is 25 * 1000 + 326
  - So, bucket0 = 326; carry = 25 (if you follow the process).

**Transcript says:**
- bucket0 = 593096 → carry=593, digit=96
- bucket0=96, top=593

**ERROR DETECTED:** These numbers are based on wrong products.

## Step 4: Recombine

Correctly, it should be:
- 25 | 326 → “25326”

**Transcript result:** Shows “25326” as answer, but all work is based on wrong chunks and operations.

## FINAL VERDICT

The split into chunks, convolution, and carrying use incorrect numbers (833/712 instead of 134/189), even though the end answer matches the direct computation. The process is fundamentally incorrect.
