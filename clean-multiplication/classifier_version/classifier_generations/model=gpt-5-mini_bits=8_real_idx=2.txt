235 x 151
A=235
B=151

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 235
  B chunks: 151

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 235*151
          = 35485

Raw buckets:
  [35485]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=35485 -> carry=35, digit=485
    bucket0=485
    top=35

Final chunks (left to right):
  35 | 485

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  35485

Answer:
  235 * 151 = 
\box{35485}

AI RESPONSE

All steps are correct.

- Chunking: with base 1000 both numbers are single chunks (235 and 151) — correct.
- Convolution: bucket0 = 235 * 151 = 35485 — correct.
- Carrying: 35485 → carry 35, digit 485 (since 35485 = 35*1000 + 485) — correct.
- Recombination: 35|485 → 35485 — matches direct multiplication 235*(150+1)=35250+235=35485.

Final verdict: \box{correct}
