11 x 12
A=11
B=12

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 11
  B chunks: 12

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 11*12
          = 132

Raw buckets:
  [132]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=132 -> carry=0, digit=132
    bucket0=132
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  132

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  132

Answer:
  11 * 12 = 
\box{132}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): With base \(1000\), both \(11\) and \(12\) are single chunks. Correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution): Only one product goes to bucket0:
\[
11 \times 12 = 132
\]
Bucket0 = 132. Correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): \(132 < 1000\), so carry \(=0\), digit \(=132\). No change needed. Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine): Single chunk recombines to \(132\). Correct.

The final stated result \(132\) matches the bucket computation and carrying.

\[
\boxed{\text{correct}}
\]
