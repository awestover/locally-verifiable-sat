9 x 12
A=9
B=12

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 9
  B chunks: 12

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 9*12
          = 108

Raw buckets:
  [108]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=108 -> carry=0, digit=108
    bucket0=108
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  108

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  108

Answer:
  9 * 12 = 
\box{108}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): With base 1000, \(9\) and \(12\) each form a single chunk: \([9]\) and \([12]\). Correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution): Only bucket0 exists: \(9 \times 12 = 108\). Correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): \(108 < 1000\), so carry \(=0\), digit \(=108\). Buckets remain \([108]\). Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine): Single chunk recombines to \(108\). Correct.

Final check: \(9 \times 12 = 108\), matches the computed result.

\[\boxed{correct}\]
