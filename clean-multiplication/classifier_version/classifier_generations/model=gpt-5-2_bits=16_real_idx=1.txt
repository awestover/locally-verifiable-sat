47563 x 63547
A=47563
B=63547

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 563, 47
  B chunks: 547, 63

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 563*547
          = 307961

  bucket1 = 563*63 + 47*547
          = 35469 + 25709
          = 61178

  bucket2 = 47*63
          = 2961

Raw buckets:
  [307961, 61178, 2961]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=307961 -> carry=307, digit=961
    bucket0=961
    bucket1=61178+307=61485

  bucket1=61485 -> carry=61, digit=485
    bucket1=485
    bucket2=2961+61=3022

  bucket2=3022 -> carry=3, digit=22
    bucket2=22
    top=3

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 22 | 485 | 961

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3022485961

Answer:
  47563 * 63547 = 
\box{3022485961}

============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking):
- \(47563 \to [563, 47]\) and \(63547 \to [547, 63]\) in base \(1000\). This is correct.

PHASE 2 (bucket products):
- bucket0: \(563\cdot 547 = 308{,}261\), but transcript has **307,961** (error).
- bucket1:  
  - \(563\cdot 63 = 35{,}469\) (correct)  
  - \(47\cdot 547 = 25{,}709\) (correct)  
  - sum \(= 61{,}178\) (correct)
- bucket2: \(47\cdot 63 = 2{,}961\) (correct)

So the convolution is already wrong due to bucket0.

PHASE 3 (carrying):
- The carrying steps are internally consistent **with their (wrong) bucket0**, but since bucket0 is wrong, the carried result is not the true product.

Correcting bucket0 would change everything:
- True raw buckets: \([308261, 61178, 2961]\)
- Carry:
  - bucket0 \(308261 \to\) carry 308, digit 261; bucket1 becomes \(61178+308=61486\)
  - bucket1 \(61486 \to\) carry 61, digit 486; bucket2 becomes \(2961+61=3022\)
  - bucket2 \(3022 \to\) carry 3, digit 22; top 3
- Final chunks: \(3 \mid 22 \mid 486 \mid 261\) \(\Rightarrow 3022486261\)

Transcript’s final answer \(3022485961\) does not match the correct product.

\[
\boxed{\text{incorrect}}
