10 x 8
A=10
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 10
  B chunks: 8

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 10*8
          = 80

Raw buckets:
  [80]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=80 -> carry=0, digit=80
    bucket0=80
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  80

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  80

Answer:
  10 * 8 = 
\box{80}

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Chunking:
- A = 10, split into chunks of 3 digits from right to left: just 10 (since it's less than 3 digits)
- B = 8, similarly just 8
-> Correct.

2. Convolution:
- Multiply each chunk of A by each chunk of B and put the result in bucket i+j.
- Only one chunk per number, so bucket0 = 10 * 8 = 80
-> Correct.

3. Carrying:
- Bucket0 = 80, which is less than BASE=1000, so carry=0, digit=80.
- No carry to next bucket.
-> Correct.

4. Recombine:
- Since only one chunk and it's the most significant, no padding needed.
- Final answer = 80.

5. Compare to normal multiplication:
- 10 * 8 = 80
-> Matches the final answer.

All steps are performed correctly with no errors detected.
