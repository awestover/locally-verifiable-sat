134 x 215
A=134
B=215

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 134
  B chunks: 215

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 134*215
          = 28810

Raw buckets:
  [28810]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=28810 -> carry=28, digit=810
    bucket0=810
    top=28

Final chunks (left to right):
  28 | 810

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  28810

Answer:
  134 * 215 = 
\box{28810}
