15 x 8
A=15
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 94
  B chunks: 5

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 94*5
          = 470

Raw buckets:
  [470]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=470 -> carry=0, digit=470
    bucket0=470
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  120

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  120

Answer:
  15 * 8 = 
\box{120}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): Incorrect.  
- The original numbers are \(A=15\) and \(B=8\). With 3-digit chunks (base 1000), the chunks should be:
  - \(A\) chunks: \([15]\), not \([94]\)
  - \(B\) chunks: \([8]\), not \([5]\)

PHASE 2 (convolution): Based on wrong chunks.  
- They compute \(94 \times 5 = 470\), but the correct raw bucket should be \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

PHASE 3 (carrying): The carry procedure shown is internally fine for bucket0 = 470, but it’s applied to an already-wrong bucket value.

PHASE 4 / Final recombination: Inconsistent.  
- From raw buckets \([470]\), recombination would give \(470\), not \(120\).
- They list “Final chunks: 120” without justification; it does not match the computed buckets.

Even though the stated final answer \(120\) equals \(15 \times 8\), the transcript’s chunking and bucket computation are wrong and inconsistent with the final result.
