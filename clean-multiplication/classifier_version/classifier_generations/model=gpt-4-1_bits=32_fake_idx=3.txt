3033118705 x 2614740413
A=3033118705
B=2614740413

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 225, 112, 642, 3
  B chunks: 615, 506, 164, 5

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 225*615
          = 138375

  bucket1 = 225*506 + 112*615
          = 113850 + 68880
          = 182730

  bucket2 = 225*164 + 112*506 + 642*615
          = 36900 + 56672 + 394830
          = 93572 + 394830
          = 488402

  bucket3 = 225*5 + 112*164 + 642*506 + 3*615
          = 1125 + 18368 + 324852 + 1845
          = 19493 + 324852 + 1845
          = 344345 + 1845
          = 346190

  bucket4 = 112*5 + 642*164 + 3*506
          = 560 + 105288 + 1518
          = 105848 + 1518
          = 107366

  bucket5 = 642*5 + 3*164
          = 3210 + 492
          = 3702

  bucket6 = 3*5
          = 15

Raw buckets:
  [138375, 182730, 488402, 346190, 107366, 3702, 15]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=138375 -> carry=138, digit=375
    bucket0=375
    bucket1=182730+138=182868

  bucket1=182868 -> carry=182, digit=868
    bucket1=868
    bucket2=488402+182=488584

  bucket2=488584 -> carry=488, digit=584
    bucket2=584
    bucket3=346190+488=346678

  bucket3=346678 -> carry=346, digit=678
    bucket3=678
    bucket4=107366+346=107712

  bucket4=107712 -> carry=107, digit=712
    bucket4=712
    bucket5=3702+107=3809

  bucket5=3809 -> carry=3, digit=809
    bucket5=809
    bucket6=15+3=18

  bucket6=18 -> carry=0, digit=18
    bucket6=18
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  7 | 930 | 818 | 55 | 389 | 725 | 165

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  7930818055389725165

Answer:
  3033118705 * 2614740413 = 
\box{7930818055389725165}

Let’s carefully analyze each step.

---

## PHASE 1: Chunking

Given numbers:
- A = 3033118705
- B = 2614740413

Transcript says:
- A chunks: 225, 112, 642, 3
- B chunks: 615, 506, 164, 5

Let’s verify the chunks (right to left, 3 digits each):

**For A:**
3033118705
- Last 3 digits: 705
- Next 3: 870
- Next 3: 311
- Remainder: 303

So the correct chunking of A is [705, 870, 311, 303] (right to left, or [303, 311, 870, 705] left to right)

**But transcript shows:** 225, 112, 642, 3
Clearly, the transcript's chunking is incorrect for A.

**For B:**
2614740413
- Last 3 digits: 413
- Then 040 (i.e., 40)
- Then 474
- Then 261

So, B chunks: [413, 40, 474, 261] (right to left, or [261, 474, 40, 413] left to right)

**Transcript has:** 615, 506, 164, 5
The chunking for B is also wrong in the transcript.

---

## PHASE 2: Convolution (Based on Wrong Chunks)

All subsequent calculations are based on these incorrect chunks. Even if the multiplication/convolution logic is correct, the source numbers being chunked wrong means the results are invalid for the original numbers.

---

## PHASE 3: Carrying

Carrying appears to be handled per the described method (dividing and moving the carry), but since the initial buckets are wrong, this phase can’t correct the fundamental error.

---

## PHASE 4: Recomposing

Same applies: the recomposed number is based on results from the previous, already-incorrect calculations.

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Step 1 (chunking) is already wrong.** This invalidates all subsequent steps. The final answer does NOT correspond to the product of 3033118705 and 2614740413.
