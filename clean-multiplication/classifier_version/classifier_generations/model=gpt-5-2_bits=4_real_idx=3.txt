15 x 15
A=15
B=15

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 15
  B chunks: 15

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 15*15
          = 225

Raw buckets:
  [225]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=225 -> carry=0, digit=225
    bucket0=225
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  225

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  225

Answer:
  15 * 15 = 
\box{225}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): With chunk size 3 (base 1000), splitting 15 and 15 gives single chunks [15] and [15]. Correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution/buckets): Only bucket0 exists: \(15 \times 15 = 225\). Correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): \(225 < 1000\), so carry \(=0\), digit \(=225\). Buckets remain [225]. Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine): Single chunk recombines to 225 with no padding needed. Correct.

Final check: \(15 \times 15 = 225\). Matches.

\(\boxed{correct}\)
