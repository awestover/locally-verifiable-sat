52966 x 56819
A=52966
B=56819

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 966, 52
  B chunks: 819, 56

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 966*819
          = 791154

  bucket1 = 966*56 + 52*819
          = 54096 + 42588
          = 96684

  bucket2 = 52*56
          = 2912

Raw buckets:
  [791154, 96684, 2912]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=791154 -> carry=791, digit=154
    bucket0=154
    bucket1=96684+791=97475

  bucket1=97475 -> carry=97, digit=475
    bucket1=475
    bucket2=2912+97=3009

  bucket2=3009 -> carry=3, digit=9
    bucket2=9
    top=3

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 9 | 475 | 154

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3009475154

Answer:
  52966 * 56819 = 
\box{3009475154}

============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking):
- \(52966 \to [966, 52]\) and \(56819 \to [819, 56]\) in base \(1000\) is correct.

PHASE 2 (bucket/convolution products):
- bucket0: \(966 \times 819 = 791154\) ✅
- bucket1: \(966 \times 56 + 52 \times 819 = 54096 + 42588 = 96684\) ✅
- bucket2: \(52 \times 56 = 2912\) ✅  
Raw buckets \([791154, 96684, 2912]\) are correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying base 1000):
- bucket0: \(791154 = 791\cdot1000 + 154\) → carry 791, digit 154 ✅; bucket1 becomes \(96684+791=97475\) ✅
- bucket1: \(97475 = 97\cdot1000 + 475\) → carry 97, digit 475 ✅; bucket2 becomes \(2912+97=3009\) ✅
- bucket2: \(3009 = 3\cdot1000 + 9\) → top 3, digit 9 ✅

Final chunks: \(3 \mid 9 \mid 475 \mid 154\) ✅

PHASE 4 (recombine):
- \(3\), then padded 3-digit chunks: \(009\ 475\ 154\) → \(3009475154\) ✅

Cross-check (standard multiplication):  
\(56819 \times 52966 = 3,009,475,154\), matching the transcript.

\[
\boxed{correct}
