12 x 10
A=12
B=10

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 12
  B chunks: 10

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 12*10
          = 120

Raw buckets:
  [120]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=120 -> carry=0, digit=120
    bucket0=120
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  120

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  120

Answer:
  12 * 10 = 
\box{120}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): With base \(1000\), both numbers are single chunks: \(A=[12]\), \(B=[10]\). Correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution): Only one product goes into bucket0:
- \(12 \times 10 = 120\). Correct. Raw buckets \([120]\) correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying): \(120 < 1000\), so carry \(=0\), digit \(=120\). Buckets remain \([120]\). Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine): Single chunk outputs \(120\). Correct.

Final check: \(12 \times 10 = 120\). Matches.

\(\boxed{correct}\)
