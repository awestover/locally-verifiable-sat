154 x 250
A=154
B=250

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 154
  B chunks: 250

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 154*250
          = 38500

Raw buckets:
  [38500]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=38500 -> carry=38, digit=500
    bucket0=500
    top=38

Final chunks (left to right):
  38 | 500

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  38500

Answer:
  154 * 250 = 
\box{38500}

All steps are correct.

- Chunking: both numbers correctly split into single 3-digit chunks (154 and 250).
- Convolution: bucket0 = 154 * 250 = 38500 — correct.
- Carrying: 38500 → carry 38, digit 500 (38*1000 + 500 = 38500) — correct.
- Recombination: 38 | 500 → 38500 — matches the product.
