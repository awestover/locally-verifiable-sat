164 x 221
A=164
B=221

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 746
  B chunks: 534

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 746*534
          = 398364

Raw buckets:
  [398364]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=398364 -> carry=398, digit=364
    bucket0=364
    top=398

Final chunks (left to right):
  36 | 244

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  36244

Answer:
  164 * 221 = 
\box{36244}

Let’s analyze each phase step-by-step:

---

### PHASE 1: Splitting into chunks

- We're multiplying 164 × 221.
- BASE = 1000, so chunks are 3 digits each.

For 164:  
- Read RIGHT to LEFT.
- It's only three digits, so one chunk: 164.

For 221:
- Same, only three digits, so one chunk: 221.

But the transcript says:  
A chunks: 746  
B chunks: 534  

These do NOT match the actual numbers. 164 is not 746, and 221 is not 534.  
**Error in the chunking step!**

---

### PHASE 2: Convolution/multiplication

- As per their chunks: bucket0 = 746 × 534 = 398364.

But again, this is wrong because 164 × 221 should be used—i.e., 164 × 221 = 36244.  
746 × 534 = 398364 doesn't correspond to the correct calculation.

---

### PHASE 3: Carrying

- Started from 398364 and split into 398 (carry) and 364 (digit).
- Then, final chunks listed as 36 | 244 (actually 364 | 244?).
- But this was based on a wrong initial bucket, so this step builds from the prior errors.

---

### PHASE 4: Recombining

- "36 | 244" → 36244, which coincidentally is the correct multiplication result for 164 × 221.
- But the entire step process was based on using wrong numbers ("746" instead of 164 and "534" instead of 221).

---

## Verdict

The steps use incorrect chunks and perform multiplication on **incorrect numbers**, although they coincidentally output the correct final answer. However, the method is not valid, and the calculation is based on errors.
