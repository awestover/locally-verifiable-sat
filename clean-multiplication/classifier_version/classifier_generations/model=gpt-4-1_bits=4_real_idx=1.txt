9 x 10
A=9
B=10

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 9
  B chunks: 10

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 9*10
          = 90

Raw buckets:
  [90]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=90 -> carry=0, digit=90
    bucket0=90
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  90

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  90

Answer:
  9 * 10 = 
\box{90}

Let’s analyze the transcript step by step:

### PHASE 1: Chunking
- A=9 → [9]
- B=10 → [10]
- Both numbers are less than 3 digits, so they are correctly chunked.

### PHASE 2: Convolution / Buckets
- Only one chunk of A and B, so:
  - bucket0 = 9*10 = 90
- Only one bucket is produced, containing 90. This is correct.

### PHASE 3: Carrying
- bucket0 = 90
- Since 90 < 1000, no carrying is needed. 
- The only bucket is 90, and there is no carry to add.

### PHASE 4: Recombine
- Only one chunk: 90
- No padding needed as it is the leading chunk.
- Final answer: 90

### Multiplication Check
9 × 10 = 90

### Verdict
All steps were performed correctly. No errors in chunking, convolution, carrying, or recombination.

Final answer:
\box{correct}
