232 x 130
A=232
B=130

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 232
  B chunks: 130

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 232*130
          = 30160

Raw buckets:
  [30160]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=30160 -> carry=30, digit=160
    bucket0=160
    top=30

Final chunks (left to right):
  30 | 160

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  30160

Answer:
  232 * 130 = 
\box{30160}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

All steps are correct.

- Chunking: With 3-digit chunks, A = [232], B = [130] — correct.
- Convolution: bucket0 = 232 * 130 = 30160 — correct.
- Carrying: 30160 → carry 30, digit 160 → chunks 30 | 160 — correct.
- Recombination: 30·1000 + 160 = 30160, which equals 232 × 130 — correct.

Final verdict:
\box{correct}
