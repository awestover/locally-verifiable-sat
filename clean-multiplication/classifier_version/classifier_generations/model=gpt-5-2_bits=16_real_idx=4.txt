61752 x 59034
A=61752
B=59034

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 752, 61
  B chunks: 34, 59

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 752*34
          = 25568

  bucket1 = 752*59 + 61*34
          = 44368 + 2074
          = 46442

  bucket2 = 61*59
          = 3599

Raw buckets:
  [25568, 46442, 3599]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=25568 -> carry=25, digit=568
    bucket0=568
    bucket1=46442+25=46467

  bucket1=46467 -> carry=46, digit=467
    bucket1=467
    bucket2=3599+46=3645

  bucket2=3645 -> carry=3, digit=645
    bucket2=645
    top=3

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 645 | 467 | 568

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3645467568

Answer:
  61752 * 59034 = 
\box{3645467568}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking):
- \(61752 \rightarrow [752, 61]\) in base 1000: correct (\(61\cdot 1000 + 752 = 61752\)).
- \(59034 \rightarrow [34, 59]\): correct (\(59\cdot 1000 + 34 = 59034\)).

PHASE 2 (bucket/convolution):
- bucket0: \(752\cdot 34 = 25568\): correct.
- bucket1: \(752\cdot 59 + 61\cdot 34 = 44368 + 2074 = 46442\): correct.
- bucket2: \(61\cdot 59 = 3599\): correct.

Raw buckets \([25568, 46442, 3599]\): consistent.

PHASE 3 (carrying base 1000):
- bucket0: \(25568 = 25\cdot 1000 + 568\). Carry 25 → bucket1 becomes \(46442+25=46467\): correct.
- bucket1: \(46467 = 46\cdot 1000 + 467\). Carry 46 → bucket2 becomes \(3599+46=3645\): correct.
- bucket2: \(3645 = 3\cdot 1000 + 645\). Top carry 3: correct.

Final chunks: \(3 \mid 645 \mid 467 \mid 568\): correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine):
- \(3,645,467,568 \rightarrow 3645467568\): correct.

Sanity check by direct multiplication:
- \(61752\cdot 59034 = 3,645,467,568\), matching the transcript.

\(\boxed{correct}\)
