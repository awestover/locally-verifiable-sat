14 x 13
A=14
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 31
  B chunks: 32

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 31*32
          = 992

Raw buckets:
  [992]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=992 -> carry=0, digit=992
    bucket0=992
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  182

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  182

Answer:
  14 * 13 = 
\box{182}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step for the multiplication 14 × 13 using the described chunked/bucket method.

### PHASE 1: Chunking
The chunks are calculated by splitting the numbers into 3-digit chunks from the right.

- 14 → [14]
- 13 → [13]

But the transcript incorrectly says:
A chunks: 31  
B chunks: 32  
This is the **first error**. 14 and 13, when chunked as 3-digit numbers (right to left), should be:  
A chunks: [14]  
B chunks: [13]

### PHASE 2: Convolution (buckets)
Suppose the numbers were chunked as:
A: [14]
B: [13]

The only product is:
bucket0 = 14 × 13 = 182

However, the transcript incorrectly computes:
bucket0 = 31 × 32 = 992

This is **the second error**.

### PHASE 3: Carrying
Starting with bucket0 = 992 (from the transcript), the handling is:
bucket0 = 992 (since < 1000, no carry).

But the bucket value itself was already incorrect from before, so even though this step matches their previous value, it's all based on a wrong calculation.

### PHASE 4: Recombine
Final chunks: supposed to be 182 (if computed correctly), but transcript claims 182, but from their incorrect chunking and multiplication, their bucket gave 992. They seem to have copied 182 as the final answer, which matches the correct 14 × 13 = 182, but it's inconsistent with their convolution step value of 992.

### Final Check
- Chunking was incorrect.
- Bucket multiplication was incorrect (wrong numbers and wrong product).
- The final answer was correct (coincidentally), but not derived from their actual chunk/bucket steps! The bucket produced 992, which was not used.

## Verdict

There are clear errors in the chunking step, the multiplication step, and a disconnect between their computed value and the final answer.
