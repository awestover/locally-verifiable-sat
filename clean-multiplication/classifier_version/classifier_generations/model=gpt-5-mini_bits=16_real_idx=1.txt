64029 x 62444
A=64029
B=62444

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 29, 64
  B chunks: 444, 62

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 29*444
          = 12876

  bucket1 = 29*62 + 64*444
          = 1798 + 28416
          = 30214

  bucket2 = 64*62
          = 3968

Raw buckets:
  [12876, 30214, 3968]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=12876 -> carry=12, digit=876
    bucket0=876
    bucket1=30214+12=30226

  bucket1=30226 -> carry=30, digit=226
    bucket1=226
    bucket2=3968+30=3998

  bucket2=3998 -> carry=3, digit=998
    bucket2=998
    top=3

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 998 | 226 | 876

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3998226876

Answer:
  64029 * 62444 = 
\box{3998226876}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

All steps (chunking, convolution, carries, and recombination) are correct and the final product matches the direct multiplication.
