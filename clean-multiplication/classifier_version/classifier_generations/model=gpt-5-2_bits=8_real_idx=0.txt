216 x 181
A=216
B=181

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 216
  B chunks: 181

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 216*181
          = 39096

Raw buckets:
  [39096]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=39096 -> carry=39, digit=96
    bucket0=96
    top=39

Final chunks (left to right):
  39 | 96

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  39096

Answer:
  216 * 181 = 
\box{39096}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

Chunks: With chunk size 3 and base 1000, \(216\) and \(181\) each form a single chunk. This is correct.

Convolution: Only bucket0 exists, and
\[
216 \times 181 = 216(180+1)=38880+216=39096
\]
So bucket0 \(=39096\) is correct.

Carrying: Base \(1000\):
\[
39096 = 39\cdot 1000 + 96
\]
So bucket0 becomes 96 and the next (top) chunk is 39. Correct.

Recombine: \(39|096 \rightarrow 39096\). Correct.

Final answer matches the computed product.

\[
\boxed{correct}
\]
