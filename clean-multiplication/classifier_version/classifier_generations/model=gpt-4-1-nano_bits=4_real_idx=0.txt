14 x 8
A=14
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 14
  B chunks: 8

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 14*8
          = 112

Raw buckets:
  [112]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=112 -> carry=0, digit=112
    bucket0=112
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  112

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  112

Answer:
  14 * 8 = 
\box{112}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

1. **Splitting into chunks:**
   - \(A = 14\) 
   - \(B = 8\)

   Since the chunk size is 3 digits, and both numbers are less than 1000, the chunks are:
   - A chunks: 14
   - B chunks: 8

   This is correct.

2. **Convolution (multiplying all chunks):**
   - \( \text{bucket}_0 = 14 \times 8 = 112 \)

   No other buckets since only one chunk for each number:
   - bucket0 = 112

   Correct.

3. **Carrying:**
   - The bucket value is 112, which is less than 1000, so no carry-over.
   - Bucket0 remains 112.

   Correct.

4. **Recombine:**
   - Final chunk: 112, formatted as a 3-digit number for output (which is optional in this case, since it's the only chunk).

5. **Final answer:**
   - The answer is \(14 \times 8 = 112\).

Now, cross-check with the actual multiplication:
- \(14 \times 8 = 112\), which matches the result.

**All steps are correct:**

- Chunks split properly.
- Convolution performed correctly.
- Carrying correctly done (none needed).
- Final result matches the expected multiplication.

**Final verdict:**

\(\boxed{\text{correct}}\)
