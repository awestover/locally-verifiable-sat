180 x 140
A=180
B=140

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 180
  B chunks: 140

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 180*140
          = 25200

Raw buckets:
  [25200]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=25200 -> carry=25, digit=200
    bucket0=200
    top=25

Final chunks (left to right):
  25 | 200

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  25200

Answer:
  180 * 140 = 
\box{25200}

AI RESPONSE

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

### PHASE 1: Split into 3-digit chunks
- 180 →
  - A chunks: [180]
- 140 →
  - B chunks: [140]
This step is correct. Both numbers are less than 1000, so each uses a single chunk.

### PHASE 2: Convolution (raw bucket calculation)
- Only one bucket (since both have one chunk):
  - bucket0 = 180 * 140 = 25200
- Raw buckets: [25200]
This calculation is correct.

### PHASE 3: Carrying (bucket normalization)
Rule: if bucket >= 1000, take (bucket % 1000) as the digit in this place, and carry bucket // 1000 to the next bucket.

- bucket0 = 25200
  - 25200 // 1000 = 25 (carry)
  - 25200 % 1000 = 200 (digit)
- So, bucket0 = 200, carry to bucket1 (a new higher chunk) is 25.

So, after carrying, final chunks are:
- bucket1: 25
- bucket0: 200

Arranged left-to-right: 25 | 200

This is technically correct.

### PHASE 4: Recombine
- Pad all chunks to 3 digits except the leftmost.
- 25 → "25"
- 200 → "200"
- Result: 25200

This is correct.

### FINAL ANSWER CHECK
- 180 * 140 = 25200

Verified independently: 180×140 = (180×100) + (180×40) = 18000 + 7200 = 25200.

## Verdict

All steps are performed correctly, and the final answer is accurate.
