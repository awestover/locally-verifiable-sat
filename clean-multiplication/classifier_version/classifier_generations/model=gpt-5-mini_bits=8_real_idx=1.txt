255 x 141
A=255
B=141

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 255
  B chunks: 141

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 255*141
          = 35955

Raw buckets:
  [35955]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=35955 -> carry=35, digit=955
    bucket0=955
    top=35

Final chunks (left to right):
  35 | 955

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  35955

Answer:
  255 * 141 = 
\box{35955}

All steps are correct.

- Chunks: A=255 and B=141 (single 3-digit chunks) — correct.
- Convolution: 255 * 141 = 35955 — correct.
- Carrying (base 1000): 35955 -> carry 35, digit 955 — correct.
- Recombination: 35|955 → 35*1000 + 955 = 35955 — matches.
