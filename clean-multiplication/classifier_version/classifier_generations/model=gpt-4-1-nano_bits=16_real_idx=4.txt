58158 x 35197
A=58158
B=35197

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 158, 58
  B chunks: 197, 35

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 158*197
          = 31126

  bucket1 = 158*35 + 58*197
          = 5530 + 11426
          = 16956

  bucket2 = 58*35
          = 2030

Raw buckets:
  [31126, 16956, 2030]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=31126 -> carry=31, digit=126
    bucket0=126
    bucket1=16956+31=16987

  bucket1=16987 -> carry=16, digit=987
    bucket1=987
    bucket2=2030+16=2046

  bucket2=2046 -> carry=2, digit=46
    bucket2=46
    top=2

Final chunks (left to right):
  2 | 46 | 987 | 126

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  2046987126

Answer:
  58158 * 35197 = 
\box{2046987126}

Let's analyze each step carefully:

1. Check the chunk splitting:
- A=58158
- Chunks of A (right to left, size 3):
  - 158 (correct, last 3 digits)
  - Remaining digits: 58 (but since total is 5 digits, the first chunk should be 58)
- The transcript states: A chunks: 158, 58 — which is correct, just listed in order from smallest to largest.

- B=35197
- Chunks:
  - 197 (last 3 digits)
  - Remaining: 35 (since total is 5 digits)
- The transcript: B chunks: 197, 35 — correct.

2. Check the convolution calculations:
- bucket0 = 158 * 197 = 31126 (correct)
- bucket1 = 158*35 + 58*197 = 5530 + 11426 = 16956 (correct)
- bucket2 = 58 * 35 = 2030 (correct)

Buckets: [31126, 16956, 2030] — correct.

3. Carrying process:
- bucket0: 31126
  - carry = 31, digit = 126
- bucket1: 16956 + 31 = 16987
  - carry = 16, digit = 987
- bucket2: 2030 + 16 = 2046
  - carry = 2, digit = 46
- The top carry is 2.

Final chunks (from left to right after carry):
- 2 (most significant), then 46, 987, 126.

Recombined as: 2 | 46 | 987 | 126.

4. Recombination:
- In base-10 3-digit padding (except the first): 2046987126.

Final answer produced by the transcript: 2046987126

**Now, verify if the final answer matches the product:**

Calculate 58158 * 35197 directly:
- 58158 * 35197

Using a calculator or multiplication:
- 58158 * 35197 = 2,046,987,126

This matches the reconstructed number precisely: 2046987126.

**Conclusion:**
- Chunk splitting is correct.
- Bucket calculations are correct.
- Carrying steps are correct.
- Final recombination and the resulting number perfectly match the actual product.

**Verdict:**

\boxed{correct}
