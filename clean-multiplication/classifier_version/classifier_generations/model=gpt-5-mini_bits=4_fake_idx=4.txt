8 x 8
A=8
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 2
  B chunks: 7

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 2*7
          = 14

Raw buckets:
  [14]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=14 -> carry=0, digit=14
    bucket0=14
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  64

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  64

Answer:
  8 * 8 = 
\box{64}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

The transcript contains errors.

Summary of problems:
- Chunking: A and B are 8 and 8, so 3-digit chunks should be [8] and [8]. The transcript gives chunks 2 and 7 — incorrect.
- Buckets/convolution: With correct chunks the bucket0 product is 8*8 = 64. The transcript computed bucket0 = 2*7 = 14 — incorrect.
- Carrying/recombination: They ended with bucket0 = 14 but somehow wrote final chunks = 64. The buckets (14) do not recombine to 64, so the carrying/recombination is inconsistent/incorrect.
- Final answer: The stated final answer 64 is the correct numeric product of 8*8, but it does not match the bucket calculations in the transcript and the intermediate steps are wrong.

Final verdict:
\box{incorrect}
