12 x 9
A=12
B=9

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 12
  B chunks: 9

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 12*9
          = 108

Raw buckets:
  [108]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=108 -> carry=0, digit=108
    bucket0=108
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  108

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  108

Answer:
  12 * 9 = 
\box{108}

Let's analyze the multiplication transcript step by step to check for errors.

1. **Chunk Size and Splitting**: 
   - The original numbers are 12 (which can be treated as 012) and 9 (which can be treated as 009).
   - The chunk size is 3 digits, and the chunks are taken from right to left. Therefore:
     - A chunks: 012
     - B chunks: 009
   - These chunks are correctly split.

2. **Convolution Calculation**:
   - The convolution step involves multiplying every chunk of A with every chunk of B.
   - The only buckets here are:
     - bucket0 = 012 * 009 = 108
   - This calculation is also correct.

3. **Carrying Steps**:
   - For bucket0:
     - bucket0 = 108
     - Since this value (108) is less than 1000, the carry is 0 and the digit is 108.
     - The carrying step is executed correctly, as nothing needs to be carried to the next bucket.

4. **Final Answer Match**:
   - The final step combines the buckets.
   - The final answer presented is 108, which matches the result of the bucket calculations.

The multiplication process had no errors in any of the steps. 

Thus, the final verdict is \(\boxed{correct}\).
