13 x 15
A=13
B=15

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 13
  B chunks: 15

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 13*15
          = 195

Raw buckets:
  [195]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=195 -> carry=0, digit=195
    bucket0=195
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  195

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  195

Answer:
  13 * 15 = 
\box{195}

Let's analyze the transcript step-by-step:

1. Splitting into chunks:
   - The base is 1000, chunk size is 3 digits.
   - A = 13, which fits in one chunk, no splitting error.
   - B = 15, also one chunk, no splitting error.

2. Convolution (bucket multiplication):
   - Only one chunk each, so one bucket:
   - bucket0 = 13 * 15 = 195, this is correct.

3. Carrying steps:
   - bucket0 = 195, which is less than 1000, so no carry.
   - Carrying is done properly.

4. Final answer recombination:
   - Final chunks: 195 (no padding needed as it's the only chunk)
   - Calculated result: 195
   - 13 * 15 = 195 is correct.

No errors found in splitting, multiplication, carrying, or final result.
