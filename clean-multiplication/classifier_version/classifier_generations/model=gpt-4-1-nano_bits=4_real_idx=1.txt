11 x 13
A=11
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 11
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 11*13
          = 143

Raw buckets:
  [143]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=143 -> carry=0, digit=143
    bucket0=143
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  143

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  143

Answer:
  11 * 13 = 
\box{143}

Let's analyze each phase carefully:

**1. Chunk splitting:**
- A=11, which is a 2-digit number.
- B=13, which is a 2-digit number.
- Chunk size = 3 digits, BASE=1000.
- Since 11 and 13 are both less than 1000, the entire number fits into a single chunk each.
- Chunks: 
  - A chunks: 11 
  - B chunks: 13
This is correct.

**2. Convolution:**
- Multiply each chunk combination:
  - bucket0 = 11 * 13 = 143
- No other chunks to multiply or sum.
- Buckets: [143]
This appears correct.

**3. Carrying:**
- Bucket0=143, which is less than 1000, so no carrying needed.
- Final bucket: 143
This is correct.

**4. Recombination:**
- Only one chunk: 143
- Recombine: 143
- The answer is 143.

---

**Comparison with actual multiplication:**
- 11 * 13 = 143
- The computed answer matches the actual product.

---

**Conclusion:**
All steps are consistent with the process, and the final answer is correct.

**Final verdict:** \box{correct}
