164 x 221
A=164
B=221

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 164
  B chunks: 221

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 164*221
          = 36244

Raw buckets:
  [36244]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=36244 -> carry=36, digit=244
    bucket0=244
    top=36

Final chunks (left to right):
  36 | 244

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  36244

Answer:
  164 * 221 = 
\box{36244}

AI RESPONSE

Let's analyze the transcript step by step to verify correctness.

---

## PHASE 1: Chunk splitting

- Numbers: 164 and 221
- Chunk size: 3 digits
- Splitting "right to left":

  - 164 is less than 1000, so only one chunk: [164]
  - 221 is less than 1000, so only one chunk: [221]

  **Splitting is correct.**

---

## PHASE 2: Convolution (buckets)

Multiply all pairs, put result in bucket (i+j):

- Only one chunk for each.
    - i = 0 (A chunk 0, which is 164)
    - j = 0 (B chunk 0, which is 221)
    - i+j = 0

- Calculation:
    - bucket0 = 164 * 221 = 36244

  **Bucket calculation is correct.**

---

## PHASE 3: Carrying

All results must be reduced to values less than BASE (1000):

- bucket0 = 36244

  - 36244 ÷ 1000 = 36, remainder 244 (carry=36, digit=244)

- So:
    - bucket0 = 244
    - carry (to next bucket) = 36 (since there is no actual "bucket1", 36 is written as additional chunk on the left)

Final chunks (left to right): 36 | 244

- This means the result is 36244 (as recombined below)
  **Carrying is correct.**

---

## PHASE 4: Recombine

Chunks: 36 (left), 244 (right), i.e., 36,244

- Recombine into the number: 36 * 1000 + 244 = 36244

---

## Check if the computed result is equal to 164 × 221

Let's verify independently:

    164 × 221 =
    164 × 221 = 164 × (200 + 21) = 164 × 200 + 164 × 21
             = 32,800 + 3,444
             = 36,244

Matches perfectly with the working above.

---

## FINAL VERDICT

All steps are correct, and the final answer matches.
