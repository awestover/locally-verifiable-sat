15 x 13
A=15
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 13
  B chunks: 25

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 13*25
          = 325

Raw buckets:
  [325]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=325 -> carry=0, digit=325
    bucket0=325
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  195

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  195

Answer:
  15 * 13 = 
\box{195}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step, comparing each step to the correct process for chunked multiplication (schoolbook/long multiplication using base 1000):

### PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)

Given numbers:
A = 15  
B = 13

Splitting into 3-digit chunks, base 1000:

- 15 as a chunk = [15]
- 13 as a chunk = [13]

However, the transcript says:
>   A chunks: 13
>   B chunks: 25

This is **incorrect**. The original numbers (15 and 13) are mistakenly swapped or miswritten as 13 and 25.

### PHASE 2) Convolution

It claims:
>   bucket0 = 13*25 = 325

This uses the incorrect chunks (13 and 25) instead of the correct ones (15 and 13). The correct multiplication here would be:
- bucket0 = 15*13 = 195

### PHASE 3) Carrying

- With 325, their process says bucket0=325, which is fine for <1000.
- But with the correct multiplication, this should have been bucket0=195, also <1000.

### PHASE 4) Recombine

They output "195", but this was not the result of their step 2 (325), so the recombination does not match the convolution.

### Answer Check

The real answer to 15*13 is 195.

They actually write \box{195} as the answer—which is mathematically correct—but none of the steps above were performed correctly to arrive at it.

---

## Final verdict

- Chunks wrongly split? **Yes (error)**.
- Buckets calculated using wrong numbers? **Yes (error)**.
- Carrying not needed, but they failed to carry the result through correctly from prior steps.
- Final answer does not match their step-by-step buckets (325 ≠ 195).
