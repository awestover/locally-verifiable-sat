TRANSCRIPT

9 x 12
A=9
B=12

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 6
  B chunks: 58

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 6*58
          = 348

Raw buckets:
  [348]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=348 -> carry=0, digit=348
    bucket0=348
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  108

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  108

Answer:
  9 * 12 = 
\box{108}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking): Incorrect.  
- With chunk size 3 (base 1000), the number **A = 9** should chunk to **[9]**, not **6**.  
- **B = 12** should chunk to **[12]**, not **58**.

Because the chunks do not match the original numbers, all subsequent steps are based on wrong inputs.

PHASE 2 (convolution): Internally consistent for the wrong chunks (6×58=348), but irrelevant to 9×12.

PHASE 3 (carrying): 348 is already < 1000, so carrying is fine (again, on wrong data).

PHASE 4 (recombine / final): The transcript claims final chunks “108” even though the only bucket is 348, so even within its own buckets it is inconsistent.

Also, the true product is \(9 \times 12 = 108\), but the transcript’s bucket math would yield 348, not 108.
