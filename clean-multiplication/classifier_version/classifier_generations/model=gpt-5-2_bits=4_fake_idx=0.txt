11 x 12
A=11
B=12

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 57
  B chunks: 76

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 57*76
          = 4332

Raw buckets:
  [4332]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=4332 -> carry=4, digit=332
    bucket0=332
    top=4

Final chunks (left to right):
  132

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  132

Answer:
  11 * 12 = 
\box{132}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking) is wrong: with chunk size 3 and BASE 1000, the number **11** should chunk to **[11]**, not **[57]**; and **12** should chunk to **[12]**, not **[76]**.

PHASE 2 (convolution) is then based on the wrong chunks (57×76), so it’s not a valid computation of 11×12.

PHASE 3–4 (carrying/recombine) are internally consistent for 4332 in base 1000 (it would produce chunks [4,332] → “4332”), but the transcript reports “Final chunks: 132”, which is also inconsistent with its own carry result (“top=4”).

Although the final numeric answer 132 equals 11×12, the steps contain errors and do not correctly compute it.
