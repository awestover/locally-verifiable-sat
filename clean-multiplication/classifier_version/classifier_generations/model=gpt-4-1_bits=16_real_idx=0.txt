37525 x 45100
A=37525
B=45100

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 525, 37
  B chunks: 100, 45

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 525*100
          = 52500

  bucket1 = 525*45 + 37*100
          = 23625 + 3700
          = 27325

  bucket2 = 37*45
          = 1665

Raw buckets:
  [52500, 27325, 1665]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=52500 -> carry=52, digit=500
    bucket0=500
    bucket1=27325+52=27377

  bucket1=27377 -> carry=27, digit=377
    bucket1=377
    bucket2=1665+27=1692

  bucket2=1692 -> carry=1, digit=692
    bucket2=692
    top=1

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 692 | 377 | 500

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1692377500

Answer:
  37525 * 45100 = 
\box{1692377500}

Let’s analyze each phase step by step:

---

### PHASE 1: Splitting into 3-digit chunks (BASE = 1000)
- A = 37525 ⇒ right to left:
  - 525 (units)
  - 37 (thousands)
- B = 45100 ⇒ right to left:
  - 100 (units)
  - 45 (thousands)
**Splitting is correct.**

---

### PHASE 2: Convolution (Buckets before carrying)

#### Arranging as:

|        |  100 (B0) |  45 (B1) |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| 525(A0)|   b0      |   b1a    |
| 37 (A1)|   b1b     |   b2     |

- bucket0 = 525 × 100 = 52500  ✔️
- bucket1 = (525 × 45) + (37 × 100) = 23625 + 3700 = 27325  ✔️ (calculated correctly)
- bucket2 = 37 × 45 = 1665  ✔️

Buckets before carrying: [52500, 27325, 1665]
**Calculations in the buckets are correct.**

---

### PHASE 3: Carrying

**bucket0:**  
52500 ÷ 1000 = 52, remainder 500  
→ carry=52, digit=500  
bucket0 = 500  
bucket1 = 27325 + 52 = 27377

**bucket1:**  
27377 ÷ 1000 = 27, remainder 377  
→ carry=27, digit=377  
bucket1 = 377  
bucket2 = 1665 + 27 = 1692

**bucket2:**  
1692 ÷ 1000 = 1, remainder 692  
→ carry=1, digit=692  
bucket2 = 692  
top = 1

Results (from bucket2 to bucket0, left to right):  
1 | 692 | 377 | 500  
**All carry steps are correct.**

---

### PHASE 4: Recombine (pad to 3 digits, except leftmost)
- 1 | 692 | 377 | 500 → 1692377500

---

### FINAL CHECK: 
Is 37525 × 45100 actually 1,692,377,500?  
Let’s compute directly:
- 37525 × 45100 = 37525 × 451 × 100 = (37525 × 451) × 100

Calculate 37525 × 451:
- 37525 × 451 =
  - 37525 × 400 = 15,010,000
  - 37525 × 50 = 1,876,250
  - 37525 × 1 = 37,525
  - Sum: 15,010,000 + 1,876,250 + 37,525 = 16,923,775

Now ×100:  
16,923,775 × 100 = 1,692,377,500

**This matches the boxed answer!**

---

### CONCLUSION

All steps (splitting, convolution, carrying, recombination, and final answer) are performed correctly.

\[
\boxed{correct}
\]
