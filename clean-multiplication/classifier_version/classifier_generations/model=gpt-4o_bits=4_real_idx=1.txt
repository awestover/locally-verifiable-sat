8 x 11
A=8
B=11

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 8
  B chunks: 11

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 8*11
          = 88

Raw buckets:
  [88]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=88 -> carry=0, digit=88
    bucket0=88
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  88

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  88

Answer:
  8 * 11 = 
\box{88}

Let's go through the transcript step by step:

1. **Chunk Splitting:**  
   - The number A is 8, and the number B is 11.
   - Both numbers are less than 1000, so they each form one chunk:
     - A chunks: [8]
     - B chunks: [11]

2. **Convolution (Bucket Calculation):**
   - According to the transcript, each chunk of A is multiplied by each chunk of B, and then placed into a bucket (i+j):
   - \( 8 \times 11 = 88 \), placed into bucket 0.
   - Raw buckets calculation is [88].

3. **Carrying:**
   - Currently, the bucket has the value 88. Since it's less than 1000, there's no need for carrying:
   - \(\text{bucket0} = 88 \rightarrow \text{carry} = 0, \text{digit} = 88\)
   - After carrying, buckets remain the same: \([88]\).

4. **Final Recombination:**
   - The final chunks, in left to right order, just stay as [88] without any additional padding since there's only one chunk.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Combining the chunks gives us the final answer as 88.

Summary: Every step from chunking, convolution, carrying, and recombination produced or confirmed the correct value, and the final answer appears correctly derived.

Conclusion: The multiplication is performed correctly throughout the entire process.
