36987 x 49083
A=36987
B=49083

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 363, 76
  B chunks: 657, 29

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 363*657
          = 238491

  bucket1 = 363*29 + 76*657
          = 10527 + 49932
          = 60459

  bucket2 = 76*29
          = 2204

Raw buckets:
  [238491, 60459, 2204]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=238491 -> carry=238, digit=491
    bucket0=491
    bucket1=60459+238=60697

  bucket1=60697 -> carry=60, digit=697
    bucket1=697
    bucket2=2204+60=2264

  bucket2=2264 -> carry=2, digit=264
    bucket2=264
    top=2

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 815 | 432 | 921

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1815432921

Answer:
  36987 * 49083 = 
\box{1815432921}

Step-by-step analysis:

Phase 1: Chunk Splitting
- The number 36987 split into 3-digit chunks from right to left should be:
  - Rightmost 3 digits: 987
  - Remaining left: 36
- Given chunks: 363, 76 - This does not match the correct splitting.
- The number 49083 split similarly should be:
  - Rightmost 3 digits: 083 (or just 83)
  - Remaining left: 49
- Given chunks: 657, 29 - Also incorrect.

So the chunks are incorrectly split.

Phase 2: Convolution
- Using the given chunks, they perform the calculations:
  bucket0 = 363*657 = 238491 (correct for those numbers)
  bucket1 = 363*29 + 76*657 = 10527 + 49932 = 60459
  bucket2 = 76*29 = 2204
- The convolution is consistent with the incorrect chunks, so internally consistent but based on wrong chunks.

Phase 3: Carrying
- Carrying is done to ensure each bucket < 1000:
  bucket0=238491
    carry=238, digit=491
    bucket0=491
    bucket1=60459+238=60697

  bucket1=60697
    carry=60, digit=697
    bucket1=697
    bucket2=2204+60=2264

  bucket2=2264
    carry=2, digit=264
    bucket2=264
    top=2
- Carrying steps are arithmetically correct for the given buckets.

Phase 4: Recombine
- Final chunks: top=2, bucket2=264, bucket1=697, bucket0=491
- The transcript gives final chunks as 1 | 815 | 432 | 921 which does not match their own carrying result; the final chunks from their own carrying are (2, 264, 697, 491), not (1,815,432,921).
- They recombined as 1815432921 but from carrying steps, it should be 2264267491 or similar from their own buckets.
- So the final recombination given conflicts with the carrying results.

Overall conclusion:
- The initial chunking is incorrect — the given chunks do not correspond to the original numbers.
- Because the chunking is wrong, the subsequent convolution is wrong.
- Carrying steps are done correctly on those intermediate sums but since the inputs are wrong, this is irrelevant.
- Final recombination is inconsistent with the carrying results.
- Therefore, the transcript is ERRONEOUS.
