TRANSCRIPT

129 x 134
A=129
B=134

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 632
  B chunks: 793

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 632*793
          = 501176

Raw buckets:
  [501176]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=501176 -> carry=501, digit=176
    bucket0=176
    top=501

Final chunks (left to right):
  17 | 286

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  17286

Answer:
  129 * 134 = 
\box{17286}

PHASE 1 (chunking):
- With chunk size 3 and BASE = 1000, the chunks should just be the numbers themselves because 129 < 1000 and 134 < 1000.
- Correct chunks would be: A chunks = [129], B chunks = [134].
- Transcript has A chunks: 632 and B chunks: 793, which do not match 129 and 134. So chunk splitting is wrong.

PHASE 2 (convolution):
- They compute 632 * 793 = 501176. That multiplication is arithmetically correct, but it’s based on the wrong chunks, so it does not represent 129 * 134.

PHASE 3 (carrying) and PHASE 4 (recombine):
- From bucket0 = 501176, carry = 501 and digit = 176 is correct for base 1000.
- That should yield final chunks [501, 176] → recombined as 501176.
- Transcript instead gives “Final chunks: 17 | 286” → 17286, which does not follow from the carry result they computed. So the carrying/recombination is also inconsistent.

True product check:
- 129 * 134 = 17286 (this final numeric result happens to be correct), but the transcript’s steps do not correctly produce it.
