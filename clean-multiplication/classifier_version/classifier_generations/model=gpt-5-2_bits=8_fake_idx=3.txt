234 x 246
A=234
B=246

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 624
  B chunks: 236

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 624*236
          = 147264

Raw buckets:
  [147264]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=147264 -> carry=147, digit=264
    bucket0=264
    top=147

Final chunks (left to right):
  57 | 564

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  57564

Answer:
  234 * 246 = 
\box{57564}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking) is wrong. With chunk size 3 and BASE=1000, the numbers are each a single 3-digit chunk, so they should be:
- A chunks: **234** (not 624)
- B chunks: **246** (not 236)

Because the chunks are wrong, the convolution is also wrong:
- They computed \(624 \times 236 = 147264\), which is not the intended multiplication.

PHASE 3/4 are inconsistent too:
- From the carry step, the chunks should be **147 | 264** → recombines to **147264**, not “57 | 564” → 57564.

Also, the true product is \(234 \times 246 = 57564\), but the transcript’s internal bucket math does not produce that.
