9 x 15
A=9
B=15

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 9
  B chunks: 15

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 9*15
          = 135

Raw buckets:
  [135]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=135 -> carry=0, digit=135
    bucket0=135
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  135

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  135

Answer:
  9 * 15 = 
\box{135}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

**Step 1: Chunk splitting**
- A = 9 → Chunks: [9]
- B = 15 → Chunks: [15]
Chunk size is 3 digits, but since both numbers are less than 1000, each has a single chunk.
✔️ Splitting is correct.

**Step 2: Convolution (bucket calculation)**
- Only one chunk from each.
- bucket0 = 9 x 15 = 135
✔️ Convolution is correct.

**Step 3: Carrying**
- Base = 1000, so each bucket needs to be less than 1000.
- bucket0 = 135, which is already less than 1000. No carrying necessary.
✔️ Carrying is correct.

**Step 4: Recombine**
- Only one chunk: 135
- No padding needed since answer is a single chunk.
✔️ Recombination is correct.

**Step 5: Final answer**
- The transcript states \( 9 \times 15 = 135 \)
- This is mathematically correct.

**VERDICT**  
All steps are done correctly, no errors found.
