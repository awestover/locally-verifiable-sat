14 x 8
A=14
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 39
  B chunks: 8

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 39*8
          = 312

Raw buckets:
  [312]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=312 -> carry=0, digit=312
    bucket0=312
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  112

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  112

Answer:
  14 * 8 = 
\box{112}

\box{incorrect}

Reasoning:
- Phase 1 chunking is wrong. A=14 should be a single chunk [14] (since base 1000), not 39. B=8 is fine as [8].
- Phase 2 convolution uses 39*8 = 312, but with correct chunks it should be 14*8 = 112.
- Phase 3 carrying is inconsistent with the computed bucket (312) and the final reported chunk (112).
- Phase 4 recombination would yield 312 if the correct bucket were used; here they end up with 112, which only matches the correct product by coincidence, not by proper steps.

Overall, the steps contain incorrect chunking and incorrect bucket calculations, so the method is not correct despite the final numeric result (112) coincidentally matching 14×8.
