14 x 13
A=14
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 14
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 14*13
          = 182

Raw buckets:
  [182]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=182 -> carry=0, digit=182
    bucket0=182
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  182

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  182

Answer:
  14 * 13 = 
\box{182}

Step 1: Split into chunks
- A = 14 has been chunked as "14"
- B = 13 has been chunked as "13"
Since the chunk size is 3 digits and both numbers are less than 1000, they each only form one chunk. The chunk split is correct.

Step 2: Convolution (multiply chunks and place in buckets)
- bucket0 = 14 * 13 = 182
No other buckets as there is only one chunk each. This multiplication is correct.

Step 3: Carrying (make each bucket less than 1000)
- bucket0 = 182, which is less than 1000, so carry=0 and digit=182.
Carrying is done correctly.

Step 4: Recombine
- Only one chunk, so no padding needed.
- Final answer given: 182

Check final answer:
14 * 13 = 182 is mathematically correct.

Conclusion:
All steps conform to the method described, calculations and carrying are correct, and final answer matches.
