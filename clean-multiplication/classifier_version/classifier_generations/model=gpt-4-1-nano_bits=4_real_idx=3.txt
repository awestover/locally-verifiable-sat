11 x 14
A=11
B=14

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 11
  B chunks: 14

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 11*14
          = 154

Raw buckets:
  [154]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=154 -> carry=0, digit=154
    bucket0=154
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  154

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  154

Answer:
  11 * 14 = 
\box{154}

Let's analyze the transcript step-by-step:

1. **Splitting into chunks**:
   - A = 11 → chunks: 11
   - B = 14 → chunks: 14
   - Since the chunk size is 3 digits, these are correctly represented as "11" and "14" (both less than 1000), which is correct.

2. **Convolution (multiplying every chunk pair)**:
   - Only one pair: 11 * 14 = 154
   - Bucket calculation is correct: bucket0 = 154
   - Since there's only one pair, only one bucket is needed.

3. **Carrying (making sure each bucket < 1000)**:
   - bucket0 = 154
   - 154 < 1000, so no carrying needed.
   - Final bucket: 154

4. **Recombination**:
   - The final answer shown: 154
   - Since only one bucket, no need for further padding or recombination.

5. **Final answer**:
   - The product computed: 154

**Verification against actual multiplication**:
- 11 * 14 = 154 (correct)

**Assessment of the process**:
- Chunks were correctly split and represented.
- The convolution step was straightforward and correct.
- Carrying was correctly handled.
- Final recombination was correct, as there was only one bucket.
- The final answer matches the actual multiplication of 11 * 14.

**Conclusion**:
All steps are performed correctly, and the final answer is accurate.
