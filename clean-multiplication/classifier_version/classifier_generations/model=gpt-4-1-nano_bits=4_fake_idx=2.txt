11 x 12
A=11
B=12

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 58
  B chunks: 94

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 58*94
          = 5452

Raw buckets:
  [5452]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=5452 -> carry=5, digit=452
    bucket0=452
    top=5

Final chunks (left to right):
  132

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  132

Answer:
  11 * 12 = 
\box{132}

Let's analyze the given transcript step by step:

1. **Original numbers:**
   - A = 11
   - B = 12

2. **Chunk size and bases:**
   - Chunk size = 3 digits
   - BASE = 1000

3. **Phase 1: Splitting into chunks**
   - A (11): Since 11 < 1000, it fits into a single chunk: 11.
   - B (12): Similarly, 12 fits into a single chunk: 12.

   **However**, the transcript states:
   - A chunks: 58
   - B chunks: 94

   These do not correspond to the original numbers 11 and 12. This indicates a discrepancy: the chunks don't match the original numbers provided.

4. **Phase 2: Convolution (multiplication of chunks)**
   - bucket0 = 58 * 94 = 5452

   This is consistent with the chunks given but not with the original A and B.

5. **Phase 3: Carrying**
   - 5452 -> carry=5, digit=452
   - Resulting bucket: 452
   - Top carry: 5

   Final "chunks" after carrying: 132 (from 5 + 452? The transcript states "Final chunks (left to right): 132", which suggests the final combined number is 132)

6. **Recombination:**
   - 132

   **Result given: 132**

### Critical Problems:

- The initial numbers: 11 and 12
- The chunks used in the calculation: 58 and 94

**Mismatch**:
- For 11 and 12, the chunks should be just 11 and 12 (or at worst, if chunked differently, perhaps 11 and 12, but not 58 and 94).
- The multiplication done (58 * 94) does not correspond to 11 * 12.

**Additional checks:**
- 11 * 12 = 132, which matches the final answer.
- But the intermediate chunks and their multiplication are inconsistent with the original numbers.

### Conclusion:
- The steps for multiplication are correct given the chunks 58 and 94 and produce 132 as the final product.
- **However, the chunks do not match the original numbers 11 and 12.** 

**Therefore, the overall process shown is not consistent with the initial numbers provided.** It performs multiplication of different numbers, not 11 and 12.
