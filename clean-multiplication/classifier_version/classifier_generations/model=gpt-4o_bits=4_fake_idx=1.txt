8 x 11
A=8
B=11

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 6
  B chunks: 68

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 6*68
          = 408

Raw buckets:
  [408]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=408 -> carry=0, digit=408
    bucket0=408
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  88

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  88

Answer:
  8 * 11 = 
\box{88}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A = 8
   - B = 11

2. **PHASE 1: Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)**
   - A chunks: 6
   - B chunks: 68

   There is an error here:
   - The number 8 should be chunked as [8].
   - The number 11 should be chunked as [11].

3. **PHASE 2: Convolution**
   - Multiplying the chunks and placing the result in the correct bucket:
     - The transcript shows: bucket0 = 6 * 68 = 408

   Since the initial chunking was incorrect, the convolution calculation is based on wrong data.

4. **PHASE 3: Carrying**
   - Since the only bucket0 is 408, no carrying is needed.

5. **PHASE 4: Recombine**
   - Final chunks: 88
   - This derived from the wrong convolution.

6. **Answered Presented**:
   - The process states: 8 * 11 = 88, which is incorrect.

Overall, there is an error in the chunking phase, leading the entire calculation astray. Thus, the multiplication was not performed correctly.
