14 x 13
A=14
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 14
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 14*13
          = 182

Raw buckets:
  [182]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=182 -> carry=0, digit=182
    bucket0=182
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  182

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  182

Answer:
  14 * 13 = 
\box{182}

Let's analyze each phase step by step according to the transcript:

### PHASE 1: Splitting into Chunks
- 14 and 13 are both less than 1000, so chunking into 3-digit pieces gives:
  - A chunks: 14
  - B chunks: 13
- This is correct.

### PHASE 2: Convolution (Raw Buckets Calculation)
Calculate the products for each pair:
- Only one chunk per number, so only one product:
  - bucket0 = 14 * 13 = 182
- Calculation: 14 × 13 = 182.
- This step is correct.

### PHASE 3: Carrying
Since BASE = 1000, each bucket must be < 1000.
- bucket0 = 182 ⇒ carry = 0, digit = 182
- Only one bucket, so nothing to carry over.
- This step is correct.

### PHASE 4: Recombine
Recombine the digits (left to right):
- Just 182, no padding needed.
- This step is correct.

### Final Answer Check
14 × 13 = 182 (check with simple arithmetic).
- This matches the computed result.

## Final Verdict

Each phase was performed correctly, and the final answer matches the expected product.
