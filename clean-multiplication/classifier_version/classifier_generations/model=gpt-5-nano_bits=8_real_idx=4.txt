134 x 175
A=134
B=175

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 134
  B chunks: 175

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 134*175
          = 23450

Raw buckets:
  [23450]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=23450 -> carry=23, digit=450
    bucket0=450
    top=23

Final chunks (left to right):
  23 | 450

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  23450

Answer:
  134 * 175 = 
\box{23450}
