2643609156 x 2491526008
A=2643609156
B=2491526008

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 126, 874, 372, 5
  B chunks: 23, 330, 813, 2

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 126*23
          = 2898

  bucket1 = 126*330 + 874*23
          = 41580 + 20102
          = 61682

  bucket2 = 126*813 + 874*330 + 372*23
          = 102438 + 288420 + 8556
          = 390858 + 8556
          = 399414

  bucket3 = 126*2 + 874*813 + 372*330 + 5*23
          = 252 + 710562 + 122760 + 115
          = 710814 + 122760 + 115
          = 833574 + 115
          = 833689

  bucket4 = 874*2 + 372*813 + 5*330
          = 1748 + 302436 + 1650
          = 304184 + 1650
          = 305834

  bucket5 = 372*2 + 5*813
          = 744 + 4065
          = 4809

  bucket6 = 5*2
          = 10

Raw buckets:
  [2898, 61682, 399414, 833689, 305834, 4809, 10]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=2898 -> carry=2, digit=898
    bucket0=898
    bucket1=61682+2=61684

  bucket1=61684 -> carry=61, digit=684
    bucket1=684
    bucket2=399414+61=399475

  bucket2=399475 -> carry=399, digit=475
    bucket2=475
    bucket3=833689+399=834088

  bucket3=834088 -> carry=834, digit=88
    bucket3=88
    bucket4=305834+834=306668

  bucket4=306668 -> carry=306, digit=668
    bucket4=668
    bucket5=4809+306=5115

  bucket5=5115 -> carry=5, digit=115
    bucket5=115
    bucket6=10+5=15

  bucket6=15 -> carry=0, digit=15
    bucket6=15
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  6 | 586 | 620 | 967 | 160 | 929 | 248

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  6586620967160929248

Answer:
  2643609156 * 2491526008 = 
\box{6586620967160929248}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking) is wrong.

- With 3-digit chunks, \(A=2643609156\) should split (right to left) as:
  - \(2 \mid 643 \mid 609 \mid 156\)
- But the transcript has \(A\) chunks: \(126, 874, 372, 5\), which do not correspond to \(2643609156\) at all.
- Likewise \(B=2491526008\) should split as:
  - \(2 \mid 491 \mid 526 \mid 008\)
- But the transcript has \(B\) chunks: \(23, 330, 813, 2\), also not matching.

Since the very first step uses incorrect chunks, the convolution, carries, and final recombination are not computing the stated product.

Additionally, even internally the “Final chunks (left to right)” listed:
- \(6 \mid 586 \mid 620 \mid 967 \mid 160 \mid 929 \mid 248\)

does **not** match the carried bucket results they had:
- bucket6..bucket0 = \(15,115,668,88,475,684,898\) (which would recombine to \(15115668088475684898\), not their number).

Therefore the transcript contains errors.

\[
\boxed{incorrect}
\]
