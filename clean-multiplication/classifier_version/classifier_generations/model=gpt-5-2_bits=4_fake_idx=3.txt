15 x 15
A=15
B=15

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 45
  B chunks: 33

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 45*33
          = 1485

Raw buckets:
  [1485]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=1485 -> carry=1, digit=485
    bucket0=485
    top=1

Final chunks (left to right):
  225

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  225

Answer:
  15 * 15 = 
\box{225}

PHASE 1 (chunking): Incorrect. With chunk size 3 (base 1000), the numbers should be single chunks:
- \(A=15 \rightarrow [15]\), not \(45\)
- \(B=15 \rightarrow [15]\), not \(33\)

PHASE 2 (convolution): Uses the wrong chunks. It computes \(45 \times 33 = 1485\), which is not based on the original inputs.

PHASE 3 (carrying): The carry step on 1485 is arithmetically fine: \(1485 = 1\cdot 1000 + 485\). But then the transcript mishandles the result:
- It shows final chunks as “225”, which does not correspond to the carried buckets \([485]\) with top carry \(1\) (that would recombine to \(1\,485\)).

PHASE 4 (recombine): Does not match the carried buckets shown.

Even though \(15 \times 15 = 225\) is the true product, the transcript’s chunking and bucket/carry reconstruction are inconsistent and incorrect.
