15 x 8
A=15
B=8

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 15
  B chunks: 8

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 15*8
          = 120

Raw buckets:
  [120]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=120 -> carry=0, digit=120
    bucket0=120
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  120

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  120

Answer:
  15 * 8 = 
\box{120}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking):  
- With base 1000, \(15\) splits into one chunk \([15]\) and \(8\) into one chunk \([8]\). Correct.

PHASE 2 (convolution):  
- Only bucket0 exists: \(15 \times 8 = 120\). Correct.

PHASE 3 (carrying):  
- \(120 < 1000\), so carry \(=0\), digit \(=120\). Bucket remains 120. Correct.

PHASE 4 (recombine):  
- Single chunk recombines to \(120\). Correct.

Final check: \(15 \times 8 = 120\). Matches.

\(\boxed{correct}\)
