15 x 13
A=15
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 15
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 15*13
          = 195

Raw buckets:
  [195]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=195 -> carry=0, digit=195
    bucket0=195
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  195

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  195

Answer:
  15 * 13 = 
\box{195}

Let's analyze each phase step-by-step:

---

### PHASE 1) Chunk Splitting

- 15 and 13 both have fewer than 3 digits, so each is a single chunk:
  - A chunks: [15]
  - B chunks: [13]
- **This is correct.**

---

### PHASE 2) Convolution (Bucket Calculation)

- Only one bucket (bucket0), since both numbers have one chunk each:
  - bucket0 = 15 × 13 = 195
- **This is correct.**

---

### PHASE 3) Carrying

- Only one bucket, value is 195 < 1000, so no carry:
  - bucket0 = 195, carry=0, remaining 195 in bucket0
- **This is correct.**

---

### PHASE 4) Recombine

- Only one chunk, so result is 195.
- **This is correct.**

---

### FINAL CHECK

- 15 × 13 = 195 (verified by standard multiplication).
- The process and the answer are both correct.

---

**Final verdict:**  
\box{correct}
