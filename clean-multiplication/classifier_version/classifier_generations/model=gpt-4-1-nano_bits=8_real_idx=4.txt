136 x 142
A=136
B=142

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 136
  B chunks: 142

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 136*142
          = 19312

Raw buckets:
  [19312]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=19312 -> carry=19, digit=312
    bucket0=312
    top=19

Final chunks (left to right):
  19 | 312

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  19312

Answer:
  136 * 142 = 
\box{19312}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

Let's analyze each step of the transcript carefully:

1. **Splitting into chunks:**
   - \(A=136\) (single chunk), which is correct.
   - \(B=142\) (single chunk), which is correct.
   - Since both are less than 1000, splitting into 3-digit chunks is accurate.

2. **Convolution (multiplying chunks):**
   - Only one pair: \(136 \times 142 = 19312\).
   - The bucket for position \(i + j = 0 + 0 = 0\): bucket0 = 19312, correct.

3. **Carrying:**
   - \(19312\) divided by 1000:
     - carry = 19
     - digit = 312
   - Final chunks after carrying:
     - bucket0 = 312
     - remaining carry = 19 (which becomes the next chunk, i.e., the high part)
   - The final two chunks:
     - Left to right: '19' and '312'

4. **Recombination:**
   - The combined number from these chunks: "19" and "312" is equivalent to \(19 \times 1000 + 312 = 19312\).
   - The final answer is shown as 19312, which matches the computed value after carrying.

5. **Comparison with actual multiplication:**
   - \(136 \times 142\):
     \[
     136 \times 142 = 136 \times (100 + 40 + 2) = 136 \times 100 + 136 \times 40 + 136 \times 2
     = 13600 + 5440 + 272 = 19312
     \]
   - The final answer matches the actual multiplication result.

**Final assessment:**

- Chunking was done correctly.
- The convolution (multiplication within buckets) was correct.
- The carrying process was executed properly.
- The final reconstructed number matches the actual product.

**Verdict:**

\(\boxed{\text{correct}}\)
