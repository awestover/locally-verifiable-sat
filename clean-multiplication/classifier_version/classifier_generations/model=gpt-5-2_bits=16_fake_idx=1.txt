46990 x 49837
A=46990
B=49837

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 210, 10
  B chunks: 813, 73

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 210*813
          = 170730

  bucket1 = 210*73 + 10*813
          = 15330 + 8130
          = 23460

  bucket2 = 10*73
          = 730

Raw buckets:
  [170730, 23460, 730]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=170730 -> carry=170, digit=730
    bucket0=730
    bucket1=23460+170=23630

  bucket1=23630 -> carry=23, digit=630
    bucket1=630
    bucket2=730+23=753

  bucket2=753 -> carry=0, digit=753
    bucket2=753
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  2 | 341 | 840 | 630

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  2341840630

Answer:
  46990 * 49837 = 
\box{2341840630}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking) is wrong.

- With chunk size 3 (base 1000),  
  \(A=46990\) should split as \([46, 990]\), not \([210, 10]\).  
  \(B=49837\) should split as \([49, 837]\), not \([813, 73]\).

Since the chunks are incorrect, the convolution and all later steps cannot represent \(46990 \times 49837\).

Even internally, PHASE 3/Final chunks are inconsistent:
- After carrying, the buckets are \([730, 630, 753]\) with top \(0\), so the final chunks should be \(753 \mid 630 \mid 730\), i.e. \(753630730\), **not** \(2 \mid 341 \mid 840 \mid 630\) (which doesn’t match any prior bucket state).

Also, the true product is:
\[
46990 \times 49837 = 2342342630
\]
which does not match the transcript’s \(2341840630\).

\[
\boxed{incorrect}
\]
