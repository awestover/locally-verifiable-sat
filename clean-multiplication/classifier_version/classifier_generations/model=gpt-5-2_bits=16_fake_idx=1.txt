47563 x 63547
A=47563
B=63547

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 511, 55
  B chunks: 581, 37

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 511*581
          = 296891

  bucket1 = 511*37 + 55*581
          = 18907 + 31955
          = 50862

  bucket2 = 55*37
          = 2035

Raw buckets:
  [296891, 50862, 2035]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=296891 -> carry=296, digit=891
    bucket0=891
    bucket1=50862+296=51158

  bucket1=51158 -> carry=51, digit=158
    bucket1=158
    bucket2=2035+51=2086

  bucket2=2086 -> carry=2, digit=86
    bucket2=86
    top=2

Final chunks (left to right):
  3 | 22 | 485 | 961

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  3022485961

Answer:
  47563 * 63547 = 
\box{3022485961}

AI RESPONSE
============================================================

PHASE 1 (chunking):
- With chunk size 3 (base 1000), \(47563\) should split into \([47,\ 563]\), not \([55,\ 511]\).
- \(63547\) should split into \([63,\ 547]\), not \([37,\ 581]\).
So the chunk split is already wrong.

PHASE 2 (bucket products):
- Even using their (incorrect) chunks, some arithmetic is wrong:
  - \(55 \times 581 = 31955\) is correct.
  - \(511 \times 37 = 18907\) is correct.
  - But \(511 \times 581 = 296891\) is **wrong** (it equals \(296891\)? actually \(581\times 511 = 296{,}891\) is correct). So bucket0 is fine under their chunks.
So convolution is consistent with their chunks, but chunks are wrong relative to the original numbers.

PHASE 3 (carrying):
Starting raw buckets: \([296891,\ 50862,\ 2035]\)
- Carry from bucket0: \(296891 = 296\cdot 1000 + 891\) OK → bucket1 becomes \(50862+296=51158\) OK
- Carry from bucket1: \(51158 = 51\cdot 1000 + 158\) OK → bucket2 becomes \(2035+51=2086\) OK
- Carry from bucket2: \(2086 = 2\cdot 1000 + 86\) OK → top = 2

So the carrying is correct for those buckets.

Final chunks they *should* get from that carry result are:
- top | bucket2 | bucket1 | bucket0 = \(2\ |\ 86\ |\ 158\ |\ 891\)
But the transcript instead gives:
- \(3\ |\ 22\ |\ 485\ |\ 961\), which does not match their own carried buckets.

PHASE 4 (recombine):
- From the *correct* carried chunks \(2|86|158|891\), the recombined number would be \(2086158891\), not \(3022485961\).

Also, the true product:
- \(47563 \times 63547 = 3022403461\), which differs from their boxed result.

Verdict: there are multiple errors (wrong chunking, wrong final chunks/recombination, wrong final product).
