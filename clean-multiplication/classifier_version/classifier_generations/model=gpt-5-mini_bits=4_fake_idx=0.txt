12 x 11
A=12
B=11

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 14
  B chunks: 23

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 14*23
          = 322

Raw buckets:
  [322]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=322 -> carry=0, digit=322
    bucket0=322
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  132

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  132

Answer:
  12 * 11 = 
\box{132}

Verdict: \box{incorrect}

Reasons (step-by-step):
1. Chunk split is wrong. With chunk size = 3 and numbers A = 12, B = 11, the correct 3-digit chunks (right-to-left) are:
   - A chunks: [12]
   - B chunks: [11]
   The transcript lists A chunks = 14 and B chunks = 23, which is incorrect.

2. Convolution/buckets are inconsistent. If you multiply the listed (wrong) chunks 14*23 you do get 322 (their bucket0), so that multiplication is computed correctly for those wrong chunks. But the correct convolution for the original numbers is 12*11 = 132, so the bucket should be 132, not 322.

3. Carrying step is incorrectly applied/recorded. They had bucket0 = 322 and then somehow ended with final chunks = 132. There is no valid carrying operation (in base 1000) that turns 322 into 132 — carrying would only split values >=1000. So the change from 322 to 132 is an error.

4. Final answer matches the true product by coincidence. 12 * 11 = 132 is numerically correct, but the intermediate chunking and bucket work are incorrect and inconsistent with that result.

Summary: The final numeric result is correct, but the process contains multiple errors (wrong chunking and an invalid change from bucket value 322 to final chunk 132). Therefore the transcript is incorrect.
