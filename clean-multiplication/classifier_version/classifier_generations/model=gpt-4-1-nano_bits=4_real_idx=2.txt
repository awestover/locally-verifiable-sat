11 x 12
A=11
B=12

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 11
  B chunks: 12

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 11*12
          = 132

Raw buckets:
  [132]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=132 -> carry=0, digit=132
    bucket0=132
    top=0

Final chunks (left to right):
  132

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  132

Answer:
  11 * 12 = 
\box{132}

Let's analyze the transcript step by step:

1. **Splitting into chunks:**
   - A = 11
   - B = 12
   - Since the chunk size is 3 digits, both 11 and 12 fit into single chunks.
   - Chunks: A = [11], B = [12]. This is correct.

2. **Convolution:**
   - Multiply each A chunk with each B chunk:
     - Only one pair: 11 * 12 = 132
   - Assign to bucket (i + j):
     - bucket0: 132
   - No issues here. The bucket calculation is correct.

3. **Carrying:**
   - Bucket0 = 132
   - Since 132 < 1000, no carry needed.
   - Final bucket value remains 132.
   - The carry process is straightforward and correctly done here.

4. **Recombination:**
   - Only one bucket with value 132.
   - The final answer chunk: 132 (note that since it fits within 3 digits, no padding needed).
   
5. **Final answer:**
   - The product is written as 132, which matches the calculated bucket.
   - Also, 11 * 12 = 132, which is correct.

**Additional Check:**
- The original multiplication: 11 * 12 = 132 (correct).

**Conclusion:**
All steps—chunk splitting, multiplication, bucketing, carrying, and recombination—are performed correctly.

\boxed{correct}
