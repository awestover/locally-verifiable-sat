45872 x 34692
A=45872
B=34692

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 872, 45
  B chunks: 692, 34

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 872*692
          = 603424

  bucket1 = 872*34 + 45*692
          = 29648 + 31140
          = 60788

  bucket2 = 45*34
          = 1530

Raw buckets:
  [603424, 60788, 1530]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=603424 -> carry=603, digit=424
    bucket0=424
    bucket1=60788+603=61391

  bucket1=61391 -> carry=61, digit=391
    bucket1=391
    bucket2=1530+61=1591

  bucket2=1591 -> carry=1, digit=591
    bucket2=591
    top=1

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 591 | 391 | 424

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  1591391424

Answer:
  45872 * 34692 = 
\box{1591391424}

PHASE 1 (chunking): Correct.  
- \(45872 \to [872, 45]\) in base 1000  
- \(34692 \to [692, 34]\) in base 1000

PHASE 2 (convolution): Error in bucket1.  
- bucket0: \(872 \cdot 692 = 603{,}424\) ✓  
- bucket1 should be:
  - \(872 \cdot 34 = 29{,}648\) ✓  
  - \(45 \cdot 692 = 31{,}140\) ✓  
  - Sum \(= 29{,}648 + 31{,}140 = 60{,}788\) (not 60,788? actually they wrote 60,788, which matches) Wait: they computed \(45\cdot 692\) as **31140** (correct) but **then wrote** the sum as **60788** (correct). However they **also wrote** \(45*692 = 31140\) but in the transcript it appears as **31140**; so bucket1 is consistent and correct.
- bucket2: \(45 \cdot 34 = 1{,}530\) ✓

PHASE 3 (carrying): Correct.  
- bucket0 \(603{,}424 \Rightarrow\) carry 603, digit 424; bucket1 \(60{,}788+603=61{,}391\) ✓  
- bucket1 \(61{,}391 \Rightarrow\) carry 61, digit 391; bucket2 \(1{,}530+61=1{,}591\) ✓  
- bucket2 \(1{,}591 \Rightarrow\) carry 1, digit 591; top = 1 ✓

PHASE 4 (recombine): Correct formatting and value:  
\(1|591|391|424 \Rightarrow 1{,}591{,}391{,}424\).

Independent check:  
\(45{,}872 \times 34{,}692 = 1{,}591{,}391{,}424\), matches.
