I want to figure out how big of a multiplication problem a model can do without verbalizing it. 

Give the model strict instructions 

"you must multiply x*y. you can't think about it you need to just spit out the answer in a boxed enviroment. 

for example 11x11=\box{121}.

Just give your best guess even if you're not sure. 

----

For Ndigits = 1 up to 7
give the model 10 Ndigits digits multiplication problems. 

Plot


Ndigits VS fraction of the time that the model gets the answer correct.

Use the model GPT5.2 with medium reasoning effort. 

Tell the model "no tools, or reasoning"
