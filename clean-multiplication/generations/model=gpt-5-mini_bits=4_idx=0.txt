Multiply these two numbers using block multiplication (break into chunks and combine partial products). Minimize text - just show the numbers and calculations. Your answer will be automatically graded.

<example>
123456789 x 987654321
A=123456789
B=987654321

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 789, 456, 123
  B chunks: 321, 654, 987

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 789*321
          = 253269

  bucket1 = 789*654 + 456*321
          = 516006 + 146376
          = 662382

  bucket2 = 789*987 + 456*654 + 123*321
          = 778743 + 298224 + 39483
          = 1076967 + 39483
          = 1116450

  bucket3 = 456*987 + 123*654
          = 450072 + 80442
          = 530514

  bucket4 = 123*987
          = 121401

Raw buckets:
  [253269, 662382, 1116450, 530514, 121401]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=253269 -> carry=253, digit=269
    bucket0=269
    bucket1=662382+253=662635

  bucket1=662635 -> carry=662, digit=635
    bucket1=635
    bucket2=1116450+662=1117112

  bucket2=1117112 -> carry=1117, digit=112
    bucket2=112
    bucket3=530514+1117=531631

  bucket3=531631 -> carry=531, digit=631
    bucket3=631
    bucket4=121401+531=121932

  bucket4=121932 -> carry=121, digit=932
    bucket4=932
    top=121

Final chunks (left to right):
  121 | 932 | 631 | 112 | 635 | 269

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  121932631112635269

Answer:
  123456789 * 987654321 = 
\box{121932631112635269}
</example>

Now multiply:
13 × 13

A=13
B=13

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 2 digits, BASE = 100)

PHASE 1) Split into 2-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 13
  B chunks: 13

PHASE 2) Convolution:
  bucket0 = 13*13
          = 169

Raw buckets:
  [169]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 100)
  bucket0=169 -> carry=1, digit=69
    bucket0=69
    top=1

Final chunks (left to right):
  1 | 69

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 2 digits except the first)
  169

Answer:
  13 * 13 = 
\box{169}
