Multiply these two numbers using block multiplication (break into chunks and combine partial products). Minimize text - just show the numbers and calculations. Your answer will be automatically graded.

<example>
123456789 x 987654321
A=123456789
B=987654321

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 789, 456, 123
  B chunks: 321, 654, 987

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 789*321
          = 253269

  bucket1 = 789*654 + 456*321
          = 516006 + 146376
          = 662382

  bucket2 = 789*987 + 456*654 + 123*321
          = 778743 + 298224 + 39483
          = 1076967 + 39483
          = 1116450

  bucket3 = 456*987 + 123*654
          = 450072 + 80442
          = 530514

  bucket4 = 123*987
          = 121401

Raw buckets:
  [253269, 662382, 1116450, 530514, 121401]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=253269 -> carry=253, digit=269
    bucket0=269
    bucket1=662382+253=662635

  bucket1=662635 -> carry=662, digit=635
    bucket1=635
    bucket2=1116450+662=1117112

  bucket2=1117112 -> carry=1117, digit=112
    bucket2=112
    bucket3=530514+1117=531631

  bucket3=531631 -> carry=531, digit=631
    bucket3=631
    bucket4=121401+531=121932

  bucket4=121932 -> carry=121, digit=932
    bucket4=932
    top=121

Final chunks (left to right):
  121 | 932 | 631 | 112 | 635 | 269

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  121932631112635269

Answer:
  123456789 * 987654321 = 
\box{121932631112635269}
</example>

Now multiply:
32839 × 54403

32839 x 54403  
A=32839  
B=54403  

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 2 digits, BASE = 100)  

PHASE 1) Split into 2-digit chunks (right to left)  
  A chunks: 39, 32  
  B chunks: 03, 44, 54  

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.  

  bucket0 = 39*03  
          = 117  

  bucket1 = 39*44 + 32*03  
          = 1716 + 96  
          = 1812  

  bucket2 = 39*54 + 32*44  
          = 2106 + 1408  
          = 3514  

  bucket3 = 32*54  
          = 1728  

Raw buckets:  
  [117, 1812, 3514, 1728]  

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 100)  
Rule: if bucket = carry*100 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.  

  bucket0=117 -> carry=1, digit=17  
    bucket0=17  
    bucket1=1812+1=1813  

  bucket1=1813 -> carry=18, digit=13  
    bucket1=13  
    bucket2=3514+18=3532  

  bucket2=3532 -> carry=35, digit=32  
    bucket2=32  
    bucket3=1728+35=1763  

  bucket3=1763 -> carry=17, digit=63  
    bucket3=63  
    top=17  

Final chunks (left to right):  
  17 | 63 | 32 | 13 | 17  

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 2 digits except the first)  
  1763321317  

Answer:  
  32839 * 54403 =  
\box{1763321317}
