Multiply these two numbers using block multiplication (break into chunks and combine partial products). Minimize text - just show the numbers and calculations. Your answer will be automatically graded.

<example>
123456789 x 987654321
A=123456789
B=987654321

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 3 digits, BASE = 1000)

PHASE 1) Split into 3-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks: 789, 456, 123
  B chunks: 321, 654, 987

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B; put each product into bucket (i+j), where i and j are the chunk distances from the right; add within buckets, no carrying yet.

  bucket0 = 789*321
          = 253269

  bucket1 = 789*654 + 456*321
          = 516006 + 146376
          = 662382

  bucket2 = 789*987 + 456*654 + 123*321
          = 778743 + 298224 + 39483
          = 1076967 + 39483
          = 1116450

  bucket3 = 456*987 + 123*654
          = 450072 + 80442
          = 530514

  bucket4 = 123*987
          = 121401

Raw buckets:
  [253269, 662382, 1116450, 530514, 121401]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 1000)
Rule: if bucket = carry*1000 + digit, keep digit and add carry to next bucket.

  bucket0=253269 -> carry=253, digit=269
    bucket0=269
    bucket1=662382+253=662635

  bucket1=662635 -> carry=662, digit=635
    bucket1=635
    bucket2=1116450+662=1117112

  bucket2=1117112 -> carry=1117, digit=112
    bucket2=112
    bucket3=530514+1117=531631

  bucket3=531631 -> carry=531, digit=631
    bucket3=631
    bucket4=121401+531=121932

  bucket4=121932 -> carry=121, digit=932
    bucket4=932
    top=121

Final chunks (left to right):
  121 | 932 | 631 | 112 | 635 | 269

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 3 digits except the first)
  121932631112635269

Answer:
  123456789 * 987654321 = 
\box{121932631112635269}
</example>

Now multiply:
179 × 163

A = 179
B = 163

Chunked multiplication (chunk size = 1 digit, BASE = 10)

PHASE 1) Split into 1-digit chunks (right to left)
  A chunks = 9, 7, 1
  B chunks = 3, 6, 1

PHASE 2) Convolution: multiply every chunk of A with every chunk of B

  bucket0 = 9*3
          = 27

  bucket1 = 9*6 + 7*3
          = 54 + 21
          = 75

  bucket2 = 9*1 + 7*6 + 1*3
          = 9 + 42 + 3
          = 54

  bucket3 = 7*1 + 1*6
          = 7 + 6
          = 13

  bucket4 = 1*1
          = 1

Raw buckets:
  [27, 75, 54, 13, 1]

PHASE 3) Carrying (make each bucket < 10)

  bucket0 = 27 -> carry = 2, digit = 7
    bucket0 = 7
    bucket1 = 75 + 2 = 77

  bucket1 = 77 -> carry = 7, digit = 7
    bucket1 = 7
    bucket2 = 54 + 7 = 61

  bucket2 = 61 -> carry = 6, digit = 1
    bucket2 = 1
    bucket3 = 13 + 6 = 19

  bucket3 = 19 -> carry = 1, digit = 9
    bucket3 = 9
    bucket4 = 1 + 1 = 2

Final chunks (left to right):
  2 | 9 | 1 | 7 | 7

PHASE 4) Recombine (pad chunks to 1 digit except the first)
  29177

Answer:
  179 * 163 = 
\box{29177}
