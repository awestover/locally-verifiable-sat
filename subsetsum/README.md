Here's a thing that might be secure: 

Given a list of 256 many random 512 bit numbers, find a set of exactly half of them which adds to a certain value. 

It's clear how to make planted instances.

(If desired you could do mod a 256 bit prime, instead of raw. but that sounds frikkin annoying so idk why you'd wanna do that.)
